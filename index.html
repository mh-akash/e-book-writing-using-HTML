    <h2>PUSS JUNIOR AND ROBINSON CRUSOE</h2>
    <h2>JACK SPRAT</h2>


    <div>ONE day as little Puss, Junior, was
        traveling through New Mother Goose
        country, he came to a funny little house all
        covered with rose vines, even up to the top
        of the small red chimney they grew in crimson
        splendor. And as Puss stopped to look
        at the pretty sight, a tiny blue bird in a cage
        on the front porch began to sing:</div>


    <p>"Oh, ho," thought Puss, and he turned
        into the yard and walked around to the little
        red barn. There stood Jack Sprat himself,
        leaning against the sty, watching his pig eat
        his dinner.</p>

    <p>Well, just then, all of a sudden, a swarm
        of golden bees came humming into the little
        farmyard, and before long they had made
        a home in the empty beehive that stood
        close by.</p>


    <p>"You have brought me luck," said little
        Jack Sprat, turning to Puss. "Now I shall
        have honey, and with bees and a pig I shall
        grow rich and supply all Mother Goose
        Country with good things to eat." And
        would you believe it, the pig began to grow
        fat, and the bees to buzz out of the hive and
        wing their way over to the roses for sweets
        with which to make their honey.</p>

    <p>Then Jack Sprat asked Puss to come into
        his little house, and when he went to the
        cupboard to look for bread and butter, he
        found all kinds of good things to eat.</p>

    <p>"What luck you have brought me," said
        little Jack Sprat, but Puss was as much surprised
        as he. But pretty soon when they had
        sat down to the table, they heard a strange
        little voice from the hearth, and looking down
        they saw a tiny black cricket, who began to
        sing:</p>

    <p>"It is the little cricket that brings you
        luck," said truthful little Puss, Junior. And
        then Jack Sprat began to laugh happily, for
        up to this time the pig was the only thing he
        owned, and that wasn't very much, let me tell
        you. Oh, dear, no. Not in these hard times
        when eggs are worth their weight in gold and
        a gallon of milk costs a ton of silver.</p>

    <p>Well, by and by, Puss, Junior, once more
        went on his way, and perhaps pretty soon
        he'll find his father, the famous Puss in
        Boots, unless,</p>

    <h2>THE YELLOW HEN</h2>


    <div>WELL, a big husky giant didn't jump
        into the trolley car, as I feared he
        might in the last story, so little Puss, Junior,
        kept up his search for his dear father until
        late in the evening when he came to a city on
        Goosey Gander River. For the moment I've
        forgotten the name, but if I remember it I
        will tell you later. At any rate, it won't
        matter much, for Puss didn't stay there long.
        Well, as I was saying, he entered the city,
        tired and hungry, for he had traveled far
        that day, and as he walked up the brightly
        lighted street he heard a man say:</div>

    <p>"My good man, I'm a stranger and have
        just arrived. I have seen no string of pearls
        nor little curls on any pretty little girls,"
        answered Puss wearily, for he was too anxious
        to find a night's lodging to notice pearls and
        curls.

    <p>"Dear me!" sighed the man, and he took
        off his opera hat and flattened it and then
        snapped it out again, which made a little
        newsboy open his eyes and say, "Do it again,
        Mister; it sounds like a pistol." But the
        man wouldn't, so the little newsboy ran off
        and Puss turned away, for he had no time
        to be talking to operagoers at that time of
        evening. By and by he came to a narrow
        street at the end of which shone a little light.
        So he turned down and presently found himself
        in front of a little house. In the hammock
        on the front porch sat a pretty yellow
        hen, swinging back and forth, and every now
        and then singing to herself:</p>

    <p>"Good evening!" said Puss, taking off his
        plumed hat and bowing politely. "May I
        ask for a night's lodging. I'm tired and
        footsore, and have traveled many miles in
        New Mother Goose Country."</p>

    <p>The little Yellow Hen flapped her wings
        and fluttered down to the piazza. "Come,"
        she said, stretching out her right wing.
        "Travelers are always welcome. We hear
        little down at the end of this narrow street.
        Tell me some news, my good Sir Cat."</p>

    <p>"Are you sure you are not too sleepy?"
        asked Puss. "It was only a few minutes ago
        you were singing 'It's after ten, it's after ten;
        time for bed for Yellow Hen!'" But the
        little hen only laughed and said, "I must wait
        up for Mr. Rooster."</p>


    <p>Just then a gaily feathered rooster walked
        up the steps, but what he said I shall have to
        tell you in the next story, for it's so late now
        that I must say good-night.</p>


    <h2>DICKORY DARE PIG</h2>


    <div>YOU remember, I hope, where I left off
        in the last story&mdash;just as the rooster
        came up the steps of the little house at the
        end of the narrow street where Puss, Junior,
        was making a call on the little Yellow Hen.
        Well, he was very much surprised to see our
        small traveler, but nevertheless he was most
        polite. He stretched forth his right wing to
        shake hands when, all of a sudden,</div>

    <p>"Gracious me! Oh me, Oh my!" screamed
        the little Yellow Hen. "That awful pig will
        just spoil my stair carpet." This made the
        rooster all the more angry at the Dickory
        Dare Pig, as he called him, and he strutted
        across the piazza. "I'll spur him when he
        comes down," he said, and he waited at the
        front door. But Mr. Pig took no chances.
        He staid upstairs until the little Yellow Hen
        began to cry. "I want to go to bed." Puss,
        by this time, was also very sleepy, and the
        gaily feathered rooster&mdash;well, I think he was
        half asleep, as he stood by the front door,
        with his head tucked under his wing.</p>


    <p>"It's time for me to do something," exclaimed
        Puss, Junior, whipping out his sword
        and running upstairs two at a time. But,
        would you believe it if I told you, he couldn't
        find the Dickory Dare Pig anywhere? Puss
        looked in every room and in every closet.
        He even lifted the cover of the big clothes
        hamper that stood in the bathroom, but Mr.
        Pig was not to be found.</p>

    <p>Well, after a while, Puss looked out of
        the window. There on the roof of the porch
        was the Dickory Dare Pig. "What are you
        doing?" asked Puss, and he waved his sword
        threateningly. But the Pig only grunted.</p>

    <p>"You people downstairs are making an
        awful fuss," and he closed his eyes again, he
        was so sleepy. And, anyway, he had a very
        nice soft place, for he had spread a big woolen
        comforter on the roof for a bed.</p>

    <p>"Well, you get out of here," said Puss.
        "You have no right to take the Yellow Hen's
        nice comforter, nor have you any right to
        sleep on the roof, and if you don't go I'll
        stick my sword in you." Well, after that,
        the Pig ran downstairs and out of the front
        door, and maybe he's running yet, if a butcher
        hasn't caught him and made him into little
        sausages.</p>

    <h2>THROUGH THE FOREST</h2>


    <div>YOU remember when we left off in the
        last story, Puss had just made the
        Dickory Dare Pig get off the roof of the
        Yellow Hen's front piazza, after which the
        gaily feathered rooster and the Yellow Hen
        and Puss, Junior, went to sleep, which they
        couldn't do before on account of that dreadful
        pig snoring. Well, he never came back,
        for he was so afraid of Puss, Junior's, sword,
        that he kept on running until he lost his
        shadow, spent a year and a day hunting for
        it, and after that he sat down and rested.</div>

    <p>The next morning bright and early, just
        as the sun was waking up in the East, the
        gaily feathered Rooster began to blow his
        silver horn to wake the people before the
        morn, and some got cross when they heard his
        song, but others hurried their dressing along,
        and pretty soon Puss was dressed and the
        little Yellow Hen combed her feathers and
        came down to breakfast. And while they
        were at the table, the Rooster came in and

    <p>"I'll never let her take my eggs to market,"
        said the Yellow Hen, and the Rooster flapped
        his wings and crowed, he was so glad. And
        after that Puss, Junior, said good-by and
        went upon his journey, and by and by he
        came to a forest. Now this forest was full
        of bold robbers, but Puss didn't know that,
        so he walked in and by and by he came to a
        little hut. From the chimney a thin gray
        feather of smoke slowly made its way up
        through the tall tree tops, and around the
        front door climbed a wild vine. Puss went
        up boldly and knocked and when the door
        opened he saw a fox. At first he was somewhat
        frightened, but the fox said, "Come in,
        Sir Cat," so our little traveler entered and
        sat down.</p>

    <p>Then the fox asked him where he was
        going. "To see my dear father, the famous
        Puss in Boots," replied little Puss, Junior.
        "It's not very far from here," answered the
        fox, "but the way is dangerous. Many robbers
        lie in wait for the unwary traveler."</p>

    <p>"I have my trusty sword," cried Puss, "I'm
        not afraid."</p>

    <p>"Well, since you are so brave, I will help
        you," said the fox; "I know a way and will
        show you how you may escape the robbers."</p>

    <h2>A TURTLE AND A FISH</h2>


    <div>AS I told you in the last story, the Fox
        promised to help Puss and pretty soon
        he led him out of the little log house and
        through a thick undergrowth of young timber
        until they came to a river. "Now, the
        robbers will never think for a moment that
        you would travel by water," said the Fox
        with a grin. "Here is a little boat," and he
        pushed aside the bushes behind which lay a
        rowboat with a pair of oars.</div>

    <p>As Puss got in, the Fox gave him some
        parting directions. "Follow the stream until
        you come to a lake. Then leave your boat
        and follow the right bank until you come to
        a bridge. After that you will find the highway
        which will take you to the castle of my
        Lord of Carabas, where your famous father,
        Puss in Boots, lives."</p>

    <p>"Thank you, my good friend," cried our
        little hero, pushing off from the shore, and
        in a few minutes he was gliding down the
        stream.</p>

    <p>"Heigh-ho!" he sighed.
        way to travel, but I have had many experiences,
        so why not a rowboat instead of a
        gander or an automobile," and he bent to
        his rowing and by and by he came to a bend
        in the river, and as it was late in the afternoon,
        he decided to land and camp for the
        night. But no sooner had he landed on the
        bank than a large turtle came up to him and
        said:</p>

    <p>"This is Turtle Island. No one is allowed
        to land unless he has a permit." Of course,
        little Puss, Junior, didn't have one, but after
        a moment's reflection, he said:</p>

    <p>"I am about to visit my father, the famous
        Puss in Boots, and if I cannot remain here
        for the night, I may have an accident on the
        river. Please let me stay."</p>

    <p>"Very well," said the Turtle, scratching
        his head, "you may remain on my island,"
        and then he crawled away to his own house
        on the hill, which Puss could see in the distance.
        I think the Turtle was a disagreeable
        sort of person not to have asked our little
        traveler to spend the night with him, but
        then, you know, there are some disagreeable
        people even in New Mother Goose Country,
        and the Turtle was one of them.
    <p>The next morning, bright and early, Puss,
        Junior, got up and cooked his breakfast, and
        then he jumped into his rowboat and started
        off and by and by, as he was gliding along,
        a big fish came up to the surface and said,
        "Helloa, there!" At first Puss was startled,
        for he didn't see the fish, but as soon as he
        did, he replied:</p>

    <p>"Don't get in my way! I might push my
        oar in your eye." This made the fish laugh so
        hard that he cried, and after that he laughed
        some more, only he didn't cry that time.
        "Where are you going?" he asked.</p>

    <p>"To the castle of my Lord of Carabas,"
        replied Puss.</p>

    <p>"A long journey, my brave little cat," said
        the fish, "but keep up a brave heart. You
        are already more than half way across New
        Mother Goose Country."</p>

    <h2>PUSS FINDS A SUPPER</h2>


    <div>FOR many days Puss, Junior, traveled in
        his boat down the river and towards
        evening he heard a voice on the shore singing:</div>

    <p>Of course this made our little traveler
        laugh, for he didn't know there was a Tammany
        Hall in New Mother Goose Country
        and neither did I until Puss told me.</p>

    <p>Well, he pulled his boat up on the bank
        and got out, and after that he listened again
        for the song, but there wasn't a sound, so
        he thought the baby must be asleep. Then
        he tiptoed over to a little cottage nearby and
        looked in the window. There sat a pretty
        little woman with a baby in her arms. And
        when she saw Puss she lifted her finger very
        gently to let him know that her baby was in
        the Land of Nod, and after that she placed
        him gently in the cradle.</p>

    <p>"Come in," she whispered to our little
        pussy cat traveler and when they were in the
        nice bright kitchen, for the fire in the stove
        made bright streaks of light over the clean
        floor, she said:</p>

    <p>"Sir Cat, you are a traveler, I see. Tell
        me one of your adventures while I get the
        supper. My good man will soon be home,
        hungry and tired from his day's work."</p>

    <p>Now Puss, Junior, was tired, too, and he
        didn't feel a bit like sitting down and telling
        a story. But he was an obliging little pussy
        and he knew, like Little Tommy Tucker,
        he must pay for his supper.</p>

    <p>"Once upon a time," he began, "there was
        a famous cat, and the reason he was so famous
        was because he had done a great favor
        for his master. You see, his master was the
        youngest of three sons, who, when his father
        died, got nothing but the cat, while the others
        got the farm and the money. But he never
        complained, which so pleased the cat that he
        made up his mind to help his young master.
        And what do you think he did? One day
        his master's clothes were stolen while in bathing,
        and the king, who was passing by at that
        moment in his coach, felt so sorry that he
        gave the young man a beautiful suit and
        asked him to drive with him. Of course the
        cat went, too, and as they passed along he
        waved his paw and said, 'All these lands
        belong to my master.' By and by they came
        to a castle where lived a giant. So the cat
        ran ahead, and said to the giant, who was
        yourself into anything. Let me see if you
        can turn into a mouse!' 'That's easy!'
        laughed the foolish giant. Whereupon this
        wise cat ate him up. And when the king
        arrived, he said, 'Here is my master's castle;'
        which so pleased the king that he gave his
        daughter to wed and the young man never
        forgot how his cat helped him to fame and
        fortune. And this cat is my father," concluded
        little Puss, Junior, with a bow.</p>


    <div class='cap'>THE next morning when Puss, Junior,
        went down to the river, he found his
        boat was gone.</div>

    <p>"Now I must trust again to my red-topped
        boots," he sighed, and at once set off to find
        his dear father. By and by he saw a little
        man in the distance, who, on coming nearer,
        turned out to be Tom Thumb.

    <p>Puss picked him up and placing him on his
        shoulder, set off once more. But, goodness
        me! It soon began to rain, and Tom Thumb
        crept into a pocket to keep dry.</p>

    <p>Towards the middle of the day they
        arrived on the outskirts of a small village.
        In the distance they could hear the strokes
        of a hammer, and then, now and again, the
        whirr of a saw cutting into hard wood.</p>

    <p>"What's going on, I wonder?" said Tom
        Thumb; "sounds as if they were building a
        house."</p>

    <p>"Don't know," answered Puss, "but let's
        hurry, for I am soaked to the skin."</p>

    <p>On arriving in the village they saw what
        appeared to be an immense boat in the early
        stages of construction. It was being erected
        in the city square, the little park that stood
        in the midst of the stores and houses.</p>

    <p>Drawing nearer they heard a voice singing:</p>

    <p>When Puss and Tom halted at the side
        of the Ark a kind-looking man stopped his
        hammering and said:</p>

    <p>"It's going to rain for forty days and
        forty nights. There's going to be an awful
        deluge. You'd better stay in Arkville and
        get aboard the Ark as soon as it's finished.
        If you don't you'll get drowned."</p>

    <p>"He speaks the truth, I'm thinking,"
        answered Tom Thumb, peeping out of Puss,
        Junior's, pocket. "It looks to me as if the
        rain were never going to stop."</p>

    <p>"My good sir," said Puss, turning to the
        man, "it seems to me your advice is good.
        We'll stay in Arkville for a few days. But
        where shall we stop? Is there a hotel near?"</p>

    <p>"Over yonder is the Hotel Ark," said the
        man. "I'm the proprietor, and my name is
        Noah. Go in and make yourselves at home.
        My sons and I will follow you shortly. We
        have a few more nails to drive before we quit
        for the day."</p>

    <div>THE Hotel Ark was a comfortable sort
        of a place, not very up-to-date, but with
        enough conveniences to make the traveler
        perfectly at home. He felt even more so
        after meeting the proprietor's wife, Mrs.
        Noah, a motherly-looking woman, with kind
        blue eyes and red cheeks.</div>

    <p>"Come right in," she said as Puss, Junior,
        and Tom Thumb, both wet to the skin,
        rapped on the door.</p>

    <p>"You'd best dry yourselves in the kitchen,"
        she said, leading them down a narrow hall.
        "It's so warm in there you'll be dry in no
        time."</p>

    <p>This was good news to our two small travelers,
        for their teeth were chattering like
        twenty-four small white horses on a red hill.</p>

    <p>"Here's a chair for you and here's a chair
        for Tom Thumb," said Mrs. Noah. "I'm
        not sure about your name, but I can't mistake
        that of your little friend." Puss, Junior,
        turned and bowed. Although he was wet, he
        did not forget his manners. "My name is
        Puss in Boots, Junior."</p>
    <p>"To be sure, to be sure," cried Mrs. Noah,
        "I might have known it."</p>

    <p>The kitchen fire was burning merrily,
        bright flames shot up the chimney and sparks
        from the wood flew out like stars upon the
        polished floor. Puss pulled off his dripping
        hat and laid it down on the chair. The
        feather was much bedraggled and had lost its
        wave. Tom Thumb undid his coat and hung
        it up, and then took off his shoes and placed
        them close to the hearth.</p>

    <p>"I think my boots are half full of water,"
        said Puss, Junior; "they are as heavy as
        lead, and when I walk they make a funny
        noise." They certainly were full of water,
        for when Puss finally got them off and turned
        them over, a stream of water ran down the
        floor, nearly washing Tom Thumb across the
        room.</p>

    <p>By the time their clothes were dry, Noah
        and his three sons arrived for supper.</p>

    <p>"Still raining!" said the good man, as he
        closed the door. "I must finish the Ark
        to-morrow. We may find a lake around the
        hotel by the morning. Who can tell? But
        I shall be ready to take in all the animals and
        my family by noon at the latest."</p>


    <h2>ALL ABOARD</h2>

    <div>IT was still raining when Puss, Junior, and
        Tom Thumb awoke. They had spent a
        comfortable night at the Hotel Ark and felt
        much refreshed. After a hearty breakfast
        they again looked out of the window. The
        rain was still coming down in torrents, and
        water lay inches deep upon the street. The
        Hotel Ark was surrounded by a shallow lake
        which, however, was growing deeper every
        minute.</div>

    <p>Puss, Junior, stepped out upon the veranda
        and looked over the village square.
        Through the rain he could make out the outlines
        of the Ark. Just then a voice began to
        sing:</p>

    <p>Pretty soon Noah himself came splashing
        through the water toward the hotel.</p>

    <p>"There is no time to lose," he cried, "the
        Ark will soon be afloat. Mother, make haste.
        Tell the girls to come along. We've no time
        to lose." Mrs. Noah appeared almost immediately,
        followed by the wives of her three
        sons. Lifting up their skirts, they waded
        after Noah. Puss, Junior, picked up Tom
        Thumb and placed him on his shoulder.
        From far and near, from the forest and the
        plain, from everywhere, the animals came
        hurrying up.</p>


    <p>"This reminds me of the circus," laughed
        Puss, Junior. "I once was with a circus;
        three days or so; whenever I see an elephant
        I think of my circus days."</p>

    <p>"Let down the gang-plank," commanded
        Noah, and soon a long procession of animals
        began to enter the Ark. The rain kept up
        its heavy downpour and by noon the water
        was waist deep. All the smaller animals had
        come aboard and Captain Noah (as he was
        now called) felt certain by evening he would
        be able to start on his voyage.</p>

    <h2>PRECIOUS MOTHER GOOSE</h2>


    <div>AS the last animal came on deck and the
        Noah boys hauled in the gang-plank,
        the ark began rolling heavily, for the wind
        was high and the water rough. "Are we
        sure every one is aboard?" asked Captain
        Noah,</div>

    <p>If there was anyone more delighted than
        Puss, Junior, he could not be found aboard
        the Ark. To once more see Mother Goose
        who had so kindly carried him on her Gander
        many miles filled him with delight. He ran
        forward to greet her as she alighted from her
        faithful Gander.</p>

    <p>"Mother Goose! Mother Goose!" cried
        Puss, "I'm so glad to see you again."</p>

    <p>"Let us go in. It's getting dreadfully wet
        outside," she replied giving him a big hug.</p>

    <p>Inside the cabin all was dry and cheerful.
        Mrs. Noah had the stove burning brightly
        and her three daughter-in-laws were busy;
        getting supper.</p>

    <p>"Let me take your bonnet," said Mrs.
        Noah and before that dear old lady could
        remove her headgear, Mrs. Noah had taken
        out the big pin and undone the strings.</p>

    <p>"There, make yourself comfortable," she
        cried, pushing forward a rocking-chair.
        "And have you found your father?" asked
        the Gander, for he and Puss were having a
        fine time talking over old times.
    <p>"No, not yet," answered Puss sadly, "But
        I hear he is Seneschal at the castle of my
        Lord of Carabas."</p>

    <p>"You must be patient," answered the Gander.
        "And go in search of more adventures."</p>

    <p>"Yes," answered Puss, "and I have with
        me my good comrade, Tom Thumb."</p>

    <p>"All ashore that's going ashore," shouted
        the hoarse voice of Captain Noah. Then
        came the tinkle-jingle of the bell and the Ark
        quivered from bow to stern, and in another
        moment was off on the dark waters.</p>

    <h2>CAPTAIN NOAH</h2>


    <div>THE first night on the Ark was most
        uncomfortable. It was not an easy
        thing to provide sleeping quarters for the
        animals, and although Captain Noah and his
        three sons did their best, from the complaints
        that were heard in the morning, it was easy to
        see that very few were satisfied.</div>

    <p>"We must get up a set of rules and regulations,"
        said Captain Noah at the breakfast
        table. "It's all very well to carry a cargo of
        coal or salt but when it comes to animals it's
        quite another thing. Each animal is so
        blamed different," and Captain Noah heaved
        a great sigh as he lifted the steaming cup of
        coffee to his lips.</p>

    <p>Puss, Junior, and Tom Thumb had risen
        with the sun&mdash;that is, I should say, at an
        early hour, for of course there was no sun.
        No, indeed, there was nothing but rain and
        a wide expanse of water. Water, water,
        everywhere, but not a speck of dirt. The
        whole world seemed nothing but water. The
        only thing that wasn't water was the Ark and
        its passengers.

    <p>However, this did not keep Puss, Junior,
        and Tom Thumb from eating a hearty breakfast.
        They were good travelers, whether by
        land or sea, and to Puss, who had passed
        through many a dangerous adventure, the
        present situation seemed one of great interest.</p>

    <p>Mother Goose was also in high spirits.
        Turning to Captain Noah, she said:</p>

    <p>"My dear Captain, if it weren't for you, I
        hardly know what in the world I should have
        done. To fly on gander-back through the
        rain for forty days and nights would be
        impossible, so I have you to thank for my
        deliverance."</p>

    <p>"Don't mention it, my dear Mother
        Goose," replied Captain Noah. "I did only
        what was my duty. You know, I have
        always been the Weatherman of Arkville,
        and, if I do say it, I have hit the mark every
        time. I knew, in fact, I felt, that we were to
        have forty days and forty nights of rain.
        For the last two weeks I have published this
        in the Arkville News. To have the Ark finished
        in time was my greatest ambition, and
        now to reach Mount Ararat will be the
        crowning joy of my career.

    <p>"I've so often heard that song at the Minstrels,"
        said Mother Goose, "that I believe
        it's really coming true."</p>

    <h2>FORTY DAYS AND FORTY NIGHTS</h2>


    <div>THE Ark was an exceedingly good sea
        craft. It rode the waves and breasted
        the gale without a mishap. Some of the animals
        became sea sick. But this, of course,
        was to be expected. Even Captain Noah
        himself felt rather queer at times, and as for
        little Tom Thumb, he kept to his bed for almost
        a week. Puss, Junior, proved to be a
        very fine sailor. Not once did he feel the
        least bit ill, and was able to help Mrs. Noah
        attend to the sick passengers.</div>

    <p>Of all the animals, however, the elephant
        was the most sea sick.</p>

    <p>"Of course, it had to be the biggest animal!"
        said Captain Noah at breakfast one
        morning. "Too bad, my dear," turning to
        Mrs. Noah, "that you have such an unwieldy
        patient on your hands." Mrs. Noah only
        smiled.</p>

    <p>"He does very little complaining," replied
        Mrs. Noah, "that is one thing to be thankful
        for. Now, take the little black ant. She
        does nothing but complain all the time. I'd
        rather attend to the elephant ten times over."</p>

    <p>"Well, mother, you always had something
        to be thankful for at the Ark Hotel. I'm
        glad that on board the Ark you still keep
        your cheerful disposition!" answered Captain
        Noah.</p>

    <p>But, oh, dear me! Pretty soon Puss,
        Junior, and Tom Thumb wondered if the
        forty days and forty nights would ever end
        and if the rain would ever stop. At last, one
        day, it seemed as if the sun were trying to
        break through the clouds. And then, all of
        a sudden, the rain ceased, and in the distance
        the dim outline of a mountain appeared
        through the mist.</p>

    <p>At once the animals began to sing:</p>

    <p>As if in obedience to the words of the song
        the Ark grounded, the sun came out from the
        clouds, and every one knew the voyage was at
        an end, for</p>

    <p>In a few minutes the gang-plank was lowered
        and the animals landed. Captain Noah
        was the last to leave.</p>

    <p>"Well," he exclaimed, "we have passed
        through an awful lot. But we're safe on
        land again." "Hurrah!" shouted all the animals,
        "we're safe at last!"</p>

    <h2>UP AND DOWN</h2>


    <div >
        <div>
            WHAT is the news of the day,<br />
            Good neighbors, I pray?<br />
            They say the balloon<br />
            Is gone up to the moon.<br />
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>It was the day of the county fair. Puss,
        Junior, had bought his ticket and stood looking
        about him uncertain what to do.</p>

    <p>"They say the balloon has gone up to the
        moon," cried the crowd.</p>

    <p>"Why, I've been up to the moon," said
        Puss, Junior, "but never will I get excited
        over that?" But, nevertheless, he walked up
        to the balloon man and asked. "When does
        your next balloon go up?"</p>

    <p>"In about five minutes," replied the owner
        of the air craft. "We have an ascension
        every half hour."</p>

    <p>"Well," replied our little hero, "I would
        like to be one of your passengers!"</p>

    <p>"Pay your shilling and you shall have a
        seat in the basket," answered the owner.</p>

    <p>After waiting for perhaps an hour the
        basket car was filled. My, how the people
        cheered as the balloon ascended, and when it
        had almost reached the clouds Puss leaned
        over the edge of the basket and threw little
        notes down to the people below. "Tell my
        good friends that Puss in Boots, Junior, has
        gone up in a balloon," he wrote on one of
        them.</p>

    <p>On another, he scribbled, "Puss in Boots,
        Junior, is about to visit the Man in the
        Moon."</p>

    <p>"You had better be careful," said the owner
        of the balloon, "how do I know we'll reach
        the moon?"</p>

    <p>"If you follow my directions you will,"
        replied Puss, Junior, "for I have been there
        before and, to tell you the truth, it is a most
        remarkable place. The moon is an unexplored
        country."</p>

    <p>"Well, I'll take your word for it," said the
        navigator of the balloon express. "I don't
        know much about these sky roads, but if
        you'll kindly consent to tell me where to steer
        my air craft, perhaps we'll reach the moon
        without a mishap."</p>

    <p>"Trust to me," said Puss, Junior, "for I
        have traveled far and if I don't know the
        way to the moon, my name is not Puss in
        Boots, Junior."</p>

    <p>So the owner of the balloon steered the big
        air craft straight up to the sky. Oh, dear
        me! But strange things will happen! For
        as they were sailing along as smoothly as
        could be, there came a sudden gust of wind,
        and the balloon, instead of pointing for the
        big, round moon that shone like a silver dollar
        overhead, suddenly swerved to one side and
        before anyone could say "Jack Robinson"
        there was a dreadful explosion and Puss and
        his fellow passengers found themselves falling
        to the earth.</p>

    <p>"Good gracious!" exclaimed Puss. "What's
        the matter?"</p>

    <p>Before his question was answered the balloon
        crashed into a big willow tree.</p>

    <h2>ROCK-A-BY</h2>


    <div>IT was lucky that the balloon fell into the
        big willow tree, as I mentioned in the last
        story, for otherwise Puss, Junior, and his fellow
        passengers might have been badly hurt.
        As it happened, they were none the worse
        except for a few scratches. Puss pulled himself
        together and after arranging his clothes,
        which were torn and mussed by the branches
        of the tree, looked about him. Suddenly,
        he heard the cry of a baby, and turning
        around, he saw a little cradle swinging back
        and forth. It was fastened securely to a
        limb, and rocked to and fro as the breeze blew
        through the trembling leaves.</div>

    <p>"S-s-sh!" cried the balloon man, "We will
        wake the baby if we are not careful."</p>

    <p>"Won't it be sad if the bough breaks," said
        Puss, Junior, "it will be almost as bad for the
        baby as it was for us when the balloon fell
        into this tree."

    <p>"It might be worse," said one of the passengers,
        who stood near them on a limb, looking
        anxiously to the ground.</p>

    <p>"Suppose we take down the cradle," said
        the balloon man.</p>

    <p>"Somebody must have hung it up here,"
        said Puss, "we have no right to take it down;
        it's not our baby."</p>

    <p>"You are perfectly right," said another
        passenger. "It isn't our cradle and it isn't
        our baby, so the best thing for us to do is to
        leave the cradle and climb down."</p>

    <p>As soon as the passengers were once more
        upon the ground they demanded their fare
        back, saying that they had paid for a trip
        to the moon, and not for a fall into a willow
        tree.</p>

    <p>"This doesn't seem quite fair to me,"
        remarked the balloon man, looking ruefully
        at his wrecked balloon. "I don't think I
        should give you back more than half, for the
        first part of the journey was successful."</p>

    <p>"You didn't keep to your bargain," cried
        Puss, stoutly; "and besides, you endangered
        our lives. I don't want to pay to go up in
        the air a little way and then be hurled down
        into a willow tree; it takes all the niceness out
        of the way up and makes the way down too
        dangerous."</p>

    <p>So the balloon man paid back the money
        and turned away. "Why don't you take the
        basket car with you?" asked Puss, Junior.</p>

    <p>"It's too big to carry," replied the balloon
        man. "I'll come around for it to-morrow
        with a horse and wagon."</p>

    <p>Pretty soon all the passengers had gone,
        leaving Puss alone under the willow tree.
        All of a sudden the baby began to cry, so
        Puss sang softly:</p>

    <p>And then the baby stopped crying, so Puss
        turned away and entered the old mill that
        stood in the shade of the old willow tree.</p>

    <h2>THE ROCK-A-BY BABY</h2>


    <div>"WELCOME, Sir Cat," said the dusty
        miller. "Sit down and tell me the
        news." But just then a sweet voice commenced
        to sing:</div>

    <div>
        Down in the village all the long day<br />
        Mother's been toiling the hours away;<br />
        While up in the tree-top beneath the blue sky<br />
        Baby has rocked to the wind's lullaby.<br />
        <br />
        Waiting is over, my sweet little one,<br />
        Mother is here for her own blue-eyed son.<br />
        Home we will go, and baby shall rest,<br />
        All the night through on mother's warm breast.<br />
    </div>

    <p>"Dearie me," suddenly exclaimed the
        dusty miller, "how tired she looks," and he
        walked to the door.</p>

    <p>"Let me carry the cradle," said Puss, and
        lifting it on his shoulder, followed the grateful
        little woman down the road.</p>

    <p>When they reached the house Puss was
        tired, for the cradle was heavy, and had nearly
        slipped off his shoulder two or three times,
        and once, when the baby caught hold of it,
        Puss nearly stumbled.</p>

    <p>"Come and rest," said the baby's mother,
        opening the little wicket gate in the white
        fence. Puss looked up at the pretty porch,
        covered with a honeysuckle vine. "Thank
        you," he answered, "I will," and he set the
        cradle down on the floor.</p>


    <p>"Please look after the baby," said the little
        mother, "while I get the supper?"</p>

    <p>"I'll try," said Puss, "but I'm not used to
        babies, and perhaps he'll roll off the porch."</p>

    <p>"Oh, you can keep him from doing that,"
        replied the little mother, "he's the best baby
        in the world!" So Puss sat down and played
        with him for almost half an hour. By and
        by a little bird began to sing:</p>

    <p>Pretty soon after that the little mother carried
        the baby into the house.</p>

    <p>Puss followed her into a cozy room, where,
        on the mantlepiece, stood a tick-tocky clock,
        just striking six. The tablecloth was spread
        and everything was ready for supper. Over
        in the corner hung a cage, in which sat a big
        green parrot.</p>

    <p>"Polly want a cracker?" asked Puss.</p>

    <p>"No, I don't want a cracker," replied the
        parrot; "I want a little mouse."</p>

    <p>"What!" cried Puss, "you don't mean to
        say you don't like crackers?"

    <p>"I'm tired of them," said the parrot.</p>

    <p>"Did you ever eat a raisin cracker?" said
        Puss, with a grin.</p>

    <p>But the parrot didn't reply. Pretty soon
        he opened the door of his cage and came out.
        Puss was all alone in the room, for the mother
        had taken the baby upstairs.</p>

    <p>"I'm going to fly out of the window,"
        exclaimed the parrot. "I'm tired being
        alone all day in this house." And before
        Puss could stop him, he opened the window
        and flew away.</p>

    <p>"The parrot's gone!" cried Puss running
        to the foot of the stairs. Then he rushed out
        into the yard and found the parrot perched
        on the limb of an old apple tree.</p>

    <p>"I won't come back!" he cried. "I won't!"</p>


    <h2>SAILORS TWO</h2>

    <p>Now as soon as the old woman who lived
        next door saw Puss, Junior, climb the tree
        to catch the parrot who had flown out of the
        window, she cried, "Don't let the pussy cat
        get you, Polly."</p>

    <p>But goodness me! As soon as the old
        woman's parrot heard that he was up in the
        tree with the other parrot, and then they both
        began to scream, "I won't come back! I
        won't come back!"</p>

    <p>"I don't care what they do," said the old
        woman, "I'd much rather have a cat for a pet
        than a parrot, anyway. He has been a
        dreadful care ever since my son, who is a
        sailor, brought him home."</p>

    <p>So Puss looked down from the tree and
        said, "Then would you rather I didn't catch
        your parrot?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, let him go," said the old woman.
    <p>"But I must catch the other one," said
        Puss.</p>

    <p>"Well, you'll have to get a pair of wings,
        my dear Sir Cat," cried the parrot. "You
        may be Puss in Boots, Junior, but you can't
        fly. So I bid you farewell," and away he
        flew, and then the old woman's parrot clapped
        his wings and followed him.</p>

    <p>So there was nothing for Puss to do but
        come down from the tree. And then all of a
        sudden the old woman cried, "Why, here
        comes my son," and a sailor boy jumped
        over the fence and threw his arms around her.</p>

    <p>"My ship just got in to-day, mother," he
        cried, giving her a big hug. And after that
        he looked at Puss, and said, "Shiver my timbers,
        but that's a fine cat you have, mother."</p>

    <p>"He's not mine," answered the old woman,
        "but I wish he would stay with us, my parrot
        has just flown away."</p>

    <p>"Thank you, madam," said Puss, "but I
        must be on my way to find my father, Puss
        in Boots."</p>

    <p>"We sail to-morrow," said the sailor boy,
        "why don't you come aboard ship? You'll
        have a fine trip, and maybe you'll find your
        father at the first sea-port we reach."</p>

    <p>"Good idea," cried Puss, "I'll go with
        you."</p>

    <p>"All right, my hearty," cried the sailor
        boy, slapping Puss on the back, "you and I
        will be pals. A sailor's life is the life for me."</p>

    <p>"Then I'll be a sailor, too," cried Puss,
        "and to-morrow we will sail the ocean blue."</p>


    <h2>A WONDERFUL SHIP</h2>

    <p>"Hurrah!" cried Puss, Junior, "A sailor's
        life is the life for me." The good ship was
        at the dock, and her crew of sailor boys were
        ready to cast off the mooring lines. Puss,
        Junior, had been promised a sailor-suit as
        soon as the ship's tailor had the time to
        make it.</p>

    <p>Just then the little woman who hung her
        baby's cradle on the willow tree by the old
        mill, came walking down to the dock.</p>

    <p>"Are you going, too?" asked Puss, helping
        her with the cradle, for she had walked a
        long way and was very tired.</p>

    <p>"Yes, indeed," she replied, "because it's
        full of pretty things for baby and for me."</p>

    <p>"How jolly!" cried Puss, dancing about
        on his toes. "We'll have a fine trip."</p>

    <p>"That's what the 'rusty, dusty' miller said,"
        cried the baby's mother. "He told me this
        morning when I put the cradle in the 'Rock-a-by'
        willow tree that the ship was sailing
        to-day and that they needed a cook; so I'm
        going to ask the Captain if I may cook and
        bake for you all. I know how to make the
        nicest cookies you ever ate. You just wait
        and see what nice things we will have to eat."</p>

    <p>Then Puss helped her over the gang-plank,
        for the crew was busy loading the good ship
        with all kinds of things.</p>

    <p>Pretty soon the miller came running down
        the dock. "Here is a sack of flour," he
        panted, "I thought you might need some for
        muffins."
    <p>"Isn't that fine?" said Puss, leaning over
        the rail. "There's nothing like having plenty
        of food aboard in case the voyage is a long
        one."</p>

    <p>"I don't know where we are bound," said
        the baby's mother, "but baby will like it, I'm
        sure. One can 'rock-a-by baby' on the sea as
        well as on the old willow tree."</p>

    <p>"I heard," said the 'rusty, dusty' miller,
        as he laid the heavy sack of flour on the deck,
        and wiped the perspiration from his forehead,
        "that</p>

    <p>"Why, so they are," cried Puss, gazing
        up at the beautiful tall shining masts. "They
        are of gold, of course they are. Look, baby,"
        he cried, "see the gold masts."</p>

    <p>"He's too young to know whether they
        are made of gold or good old oak," said his
        mother, "but we'll teach him to be a good
        sailor, won't we, Puss, dear?"</p>

    <h2>ALL ABOARD!</h2>


    <div>"ALL aboard!" shouted the Captain.</div>

    <p>"There's a locket fastened to every chain,"
        cried Puss. "What pretty lockets."</p>

    <p>"Each little sailor mouse has a picture of
        his mother in his locket," said the Captain,
        who stood near by giving the orders. Now,</p>

    <p>"Hello!" said Puss, Junior, stretching out
        his right paw. "Hello, Captain! Aren't you
        the duck that took me across the pond on
        your back a long, long time ago. You told
        me about your cousin, the Golden Goose,
        don't you remember?"</p>

    <p>"So I did," said the Captain, looking Puss
        over. "Shiver my timbers if you're not Puss,
        Junior!"</p>

    <p>"The very same," replied Puss.</p>

    <p>"And haven't you found your daddy yet?"
        asked the Captain as his good ship swung
        away from the dock, her silk sails filling with
        the breeze until they looked like great big
        balloons cut in half.</p>

    <p>"No, Captain," replied Puss, sadly, "I
        haven't."</p>

    <p>"Well, we'll ask for him at every port,"
        replied the kind master of the good ship,
        which was now rolling and dipping in the
        most graceful way possible. "I'll ask every
        old land lubber on the docks when we touch
        port. We'll hear some news, never fear."
        And then the Captain went over to tell the
        man at the tiller where to go. The "man" at
        the wheel was a little white mouse, but he
        knew how to steer the ship as well as any
        pilot, let me tell you.</p>

    <p>"I don't have to rock the cradle," said the
        baby's mother, with a smile, looking up at
        Puss, as he tip-toed over to where she sat.</p>

    <p>"No, he's fast asleep," replied Puss, "and
        the big blue ocean is rocking him better than
        the willow tree."</p>

    <p>"Where did you hear that pretty song?"
        asked Puss.</p>

    <p>"Why, I just made it up," replied the
        baby's mother.</p>

    <p>"Mothers always do that when they rock
        their little ones to sleep, you know."</p>


    <h2>OLD TOM</h2>


    <div>THE next morning the good ship came
        in sight of an old seaport. The harbor
        was very safe, for a tall white lighthouse
        stood upon the rocks to guide the sailors, and
        bellbuoys clanged their solemn warning from
        the dangerous reefs. In the distance rose a
        church spire, and near it stood a little red
        schoolhouse with a flag flying in the breeze.
        Down on the wharf ran a low row of buildings,
        worn and battered, where the old sailors
        lounged and told stories of their early
        days.</div>

    <p>Pretty soon the good ship came about, and
        with her silken sails flapping in the wind,
        drifted up to the dock.</p>

    <p>"Make fast!" shouted the Captain. The
        four and twenty little sailor mice jumped
        nimbly on the dock, and in a few minutes
        made the silk ropes fast to the posts. Then
        the good ship came to a standstill, and the
        gang-plank was lowered.</p>

    <p>"All ashore that's going ashore!" quacked
        the captain.
    <p>"Oh Captain Duck," cried Puss, Junior,
        "we don't have to land, do we?"</p>

    <p>"No," replied the Duck. "But you may
        go ashore for a little while if you wish. We
        don't sail for two hours."</p>

    <p>"All right!" replied Puss, "I'll take a
        run on the grass," and he walked down the
        gang-plank across the old wharf, until he
        came to a path, well worn by the sailors who
        for years had carried the cargoes up to the
        little village. Under a tree close by sat an
        old sailor. He was smoking a big black
        pipe as contentedly as could be. But as
        soon as he saw Puss he took it out of his
        mouth.</p>

    <p>"Ahoy, my breezy little reefer," he cried.</p>

    <p>"Good morning," replied Puss.</p>

    <p>"Don't be in a hurry," said the old sailor.
        "Just moor your little hulk alongside of old
        Tom."</p>

    <p>"What's the matter, my breezy little skipper?"
        asked the old sailor after a few minutes
        silence, for, Puss, you see, didn't know what
        to say.</p>

    <p>"Nothing," replied Puss, sadly, "only, I
        can't find my father, the famous Puss in
        Boots."</p>

    <p>"What did he look like?" asked the old
        sailor, with a grin.</p>

    <p>"He looked like me&mdash;&mdash;or, rather, I look
        like him," replied Puss.</p>

    <p>"Well, my merry little sandpiper!" cried
        the old salt, "you should have stayed at
        home!"</p>

    <p>"I don't agree with you," said Puss stoutly,
        "I wanted to see the world."</p>

    <p>"Give me your flipper," said the old sailor
        kindly. "Good luck to ye. I hope you find
        your daddy."</p>

    <h2>A NEW PASSENGER</h2>


    <div>PUSS, JUNIOR, waved his paw to the
        old sailor, who put his pipe back in his
        mouth and smoked away contentedly under
        the shady tree. All of a sudden a pretty
        little girl jumped out from behind a stone
        wall.</div>

    <p>"Hello," said Puss when she had finished
        her song.</p>

    <p>"Did you just get off that pretty ship,"
        she asked.</p>

    <p>"Yes, Miss," replied Puss.</p>

    <p>"Was Bobby Shafto on board?"</p>

    <p>"I didn't see him," replied Puss. "Did
        you expect him?"</p>

    <p>"I don't know," replied the little girl, "but
        I run down to look every time a ship comes
        to the old dock. And I always ask the old
        sailor who sits on the bench over there if he
        has seen my Bobby."</p>

    <p>"You're looking for your Bobby, and I'm
        searching for my daddy," said Puss, sadly.
        And then he told the little girl how discouraged
        he was because in all his travels he had
        not yet found him.</p>

    <p>And then, all of a sudden, they heard a
        voice calling, "All aboard!"</p>

    <p>"Goodness!" exclaimed Puss, "I must
        hurry; the ship's going to sail. Good-by!"
        and off he ran to the dock as fast as he could.</p>

    <p>"Wait for me," called out the little girl,
        "I guess I'll go, too. I may find Bobby
        Shafto."</p>

    <p>"Hurry, hurry!" cried Puss, looking back.
        "I'll run ahead and ask the Captain to wait."</p>

    <p>And it was lucky he did, for the gang-plank
        was being hauled in just as he arrived.
        "Wait for us!" he shouted.</p>

    <p>"Why, I don't see anybody else," said the
        Captain, as Puss stepped aboard.</p>

    <p>"Yes, there is," answered Puss, "There
        she comes!"</p>

    <p>And in another minute, with her bonnet
        strings streaming in the wind, the little girl
        came running down the dock.</p>

    <p>"Thank you for waiting," she cried, turning
        to the Captain. "I'd have been so
        disappointed if you had left me behind."</p>

    <p>And then she stood close to Puss as the
        good ship left the dock. "Good luck, my
        little skipper," shouted the old sailor.</p>

    <p>"Good-by," cried Puss, waving his cap to
        the old salt.</p>

    <h2>OVER THE WATER</h2>


    <div>WHEN the old dock and the gray-haired
        sailor, the tall church spire
        and the flag on the little red schoolhouse were
        out of sight, Puss, Junior, turned to the little
        girl and said: "Let's go down in the cabin.
        I'll show you the cutest little baby you ever
        saw. It's the 'rock-a-by, baby, upon-the-tree-top.'
        His mother always hung the cradle on
        a willow tree so that the breeze might rock
        him to sleep. But now the ocean does the
        rocking and baby sleeps almost all the time."</div>

    <p>So the little girl followed Puss down the
        stairs to the cabin, where they heard a sweet
        voice singing:</p>

    <h2>CONTENTS</h2>

    <h2>PUSS JUNIOR AND ROBINSON CRUSOE</h2>
    <h2>JACK SPRAT</h2>


    <div>ONE day as little Puss, Junior, was
        traveling through New Mother Goose
        country, he came to a funny little house all
        covered with rose vines, even up to the top
        of the small red chimney they grew in crimson
        splendor. And as Puss stopped to look
        at the pretty sight, a tiny blue bird in a cage
        on the front porch began to sing:</div>


    <p>"Oh, ho," thought Puss, and he turned
        into the yard and walked around to the little
        red barn. There stood Jack Sprat himself,
        leaning against the sty, watching his pig eat
        his dinner.</p>

    <p>Well, just then, all of a sudden, a swarm
        of golden bees came humming into the little
        farmyard, and before long they had made
        a home in the empty beehive that stood
        close by.</p>


    <p>"You have brought me luck," said little
        Jack Sprat, turning to Puss. "Now I shall
        have honey, and with bees and a pig I shall
        grow rich and supply all Mother Goose
        Country with good things to eat." And
        would you believe it, the pig began to grow
        fat, and the bees to buzz out of the hive and
        wing their way over to the roses for sweets
        with which to make their honey.</p>

    <p>Then Jack Sprat asked Puss to come into
        his little house, and when he went to the
        cupboard to look for bread and butter, he
        found all kinds of good things to eat.</p>

    <p>"What luck you have brought me," said
        little Jack Sprat, but Puss was as much surprised
        as he. But pretty soon when they had
        sat down to the table, they heard a strange
        little voice from the hearth, and looking down
        they saw a tiny black cricket, who began to
        sing:</p>


    <p>"It is the little cricket that brings you
        luck," said truthful little Puss, Junior. And
        then Jack Sprat began to laugh happily, for
        up to this time the pig was the only thing he
        owned, and that wasn't very much, let me tell
        you. Oh, dear, no. Not in these hard times
        when eggs are worth their weight in gold and
        a gallon of milk costs a ton of silver.</p>

    <p>Well, by and by, Puss, Junior, once more
        went on his way, and perhaps pretty soon
        he'll find his father, the famous Puss in
        Boots, unless,</p>

    <div>
        A great big husky giant<br />
        Jumps into a trolley car,<br />
        And turns the coin box upside down<br />
        To see how many nickels there are.<br />
    </div>

    <h2>THE YELLOW HEN</h2>


    <div>WELL, a big husky giant didn't jump
        into the trolley car, as I feared he
        might in the last story, so little Puss, Junior,
        kept up his search for his dear father until
        late in the evening when he came to a city on
        Goosey Gander River. For the moment I've
        forgotten the name, but if I remember it I
        will tell you later. At any rate, it won't
        matter much, for Puss didn't stay there long.
        Well, as I was saying, he entered the city,
        tired and hungry, for he had traveled far
        that day, and as he walked up the brightly
        lighted street he heard a man say:</div>

    <p>"My good man, I'm a stranger and have
        just arrived. I have seen no string of pearls
        nor little curls on any pretty little girls,"
        answered Puss wearily, for he was too anxious
        to find a night's lodging to notice pearls and
        curls.
    <p>"Dear me!" sighed the man, and he took
        off his opera hat and flattened it and then
        snapped it out again, which made a little
        newsboy open his eyes and say, "Do it again,
        Mister; it sounds like a pistol." But the
        man wouldn't, so the little newsboy ran off
        and Puss turned away, for he had no time
        to be talking to operagoers at that time of
        evening. By and by he came to a narrow
        street at the end of which shone a little light.
        So he turned down and presently found himself
        in front of a little house. In the hammock
        on the front porch sat a pretty yellow
        hen, swinging back and forth, and every now
        and then singing to herself:</p>

    <p>"Good evening!" said Puss, taking off his
        plumed hat and bowing politely. "May I
        ask for a night's lodging. I'm tired and
        footsore, and have traveled many miles in
        New Mother Goose Country."</p>

    <p>The little Yellow Hen flapped her wings
        and fluttered down to the piazza. "Come,"
        she said, stretching out her right wing.
        "Travelers are always welcome. We hear
        little down at the end of this narrow street.
        Tell me some news, my good Sir Cat."</p>

    <p>"Are you sure you are not too sleepy?"
        asked Puss. "It was only a few minutes ago
        you were singing 'It's after ten, it's after ten;
        time for bed for Yellow Hen!'" But the
        little hen only laughed and said, "I must wait
        up for Mr. Rooster."</p>


    <p>Just then a gaily feathered rooster walked
        up the steps, but what he said I shall have to
        tell you in the next story, for it's so late now
        that I must say good-night.</p>


    <h2>DICKORY DARE PIG</h2>


    <div>YOU remember, I hope, where I left off
        in the last story&mdash;just as the rooster
        came up the steps of the little house at the
        end of the narrow street where Puss, Junior,
        was making a call on the little Yellow Hen.
        Well, he was very much surprised to see our
        small traveler, but nevertheless he was most
        polite. He stretched forth his right wing to
        shake hands when, all of a sudden,</div>

    <p>"Gracious me! Oh me, Oh my!" screamed
        the little Yellow Hen. "That awful pig will
        just spoil my stair carpet." This made the
        rooster all the more angry at the Dickory
        Dare Pig, as he called him, and he strutted
        across the piazza. "I'll spur him when he
        comes down," he said, and he waited at the
        front door. But Mr. Pig took no chances.
        He staid upstairs until the little Yellow Hen
        began to cry. "I want to go to bed." Puss,
        by this time, was also very sleepy, and the
        gaily feathered rooster&mdash;well, I think he was
        half asleep, as he stood by the front door,
        with his head tucked under his wing.</p>


    <p>"It's time for me to do something," exclaimed
        Puss, Junior, whipping out his sword
        and running upstairs two at a time. But,
        would you believe it if I told you, he couldn't
        find the Dickory Dare Pig anywhere? Puss
        looked in every room and in every closet.
        He even lifted the cover of the big clothes
        hamper that stood in the bathroom, but Mr.
        Pig was not to be found.</p>

    <p>Well, after a while, Puss looked out of
        the window. There on the roof of the porch
        was the Dickory Dare Pig. "What are you
        doing?" asked Puss, and he waved his sword
        threateningly. But the Pig only grunted.</p>

    <p>"You people downstairs are making an
        awful fuss," and he closed his eyes again, he
        was so sleepy. And, anyway, he had a very
        nice soft place, for he had spread a big woolen
        comforter on the roof for a bed.</p>

    <p>"Well, you get out of here," said Puss.
        "You have no right to take the Yellow Hen's
        nice comforter, nor have you any right to
        sleep on the roof, and if you don't go I'll
        stick my sword in you." Well, after that,
        the Pig ran downstairs and out of the front
        door, and maybe he's running yet, if a butcher
        hasn't caught him and made him into little
        sausages.</p>

    <h2>THROUGH THE FOREST</h2>


    <div>YOU remember when we left off in the
        last story, Puss had just made the
        Dickory Dare Pig get off the roof of the
        Yellow Hen's front piazza, after which the
        gaily feathered rooster and the Yellow Hen
        and Puss, Junior, went to sleep, which they
        couldn't do before on account of that dreadful
        pig snoring. Well, he never came back,
        for he was so afraid of Puss, Junior's, sword,
        that he kept on running until he lost his
        shadow, spent a year and a day hunting for
        it, and after that he sat down and rested.</div>

    <p>The next morning bright and early, just
        as the sun was waking up in the East, the
        gaily feathered Rooster began to blow his
        silver horn to wake the people before the
        morn, and some got cross when they heard his
        song, but others hurried their dressing along,
        and pretty soon Puss was dressed and the
        little Yellow Hen combed her feathers and
        came down to breakfast. And while they
        were at the table, the Rooster came in and

    <p>"I'll never let her take my eggs to market,"
        said the Yellow Hen, and the Rooster flapped
        his wings and crowed, he was so glad. And
        after that Puss, Junior, said good-by and
        went upon his journey, and by and by he
        came to a forest. Now this forest was full
        of bold robbers, but Puss didn't know that,
        so he walked in and by and by he came to a
        little hut. From the chimney a thin gray
        feather of smoke slowly made its way up
        through the tall tree tops, and around the
        front door climbed a wild vine. Puss went
        up boldly and knocked and when the door
        opened he saw a fox. At first he was somewhat
        frightened, but the fox said, "Come in,
        Sir Cat," so our little traveler entered and
        sat down.</p>

    <p>Then the fox asked him where he was
        going. "To see my dear father, the famous
        Puss in Boots," replied little Puss, Junior.
        "It's not very far from here," answered the
        fox, "but the way is dangerous. Many robbers
        lie in wait for the unwary traveler."</p>

    <p>"I have my trusty sword," cried Puss, "I'm
        not afraid."</p>

    <p>"Well, since you are so brave, I will help
        you," said the fox; "I know a way and will
        show you how you may escape the robbers."</p>

    <h2>A TURTLE AND A FISH</h2>


    <div>AS I told you in the last story, the Fox
        promised to help Puss and pretty soon
        he led him out of the little log house and
        through a thick undergrowth of young timber
        until they came to a river. "Now, the
        robbers will never think for a moment that
        you would travel by water," said the Fox
        with a grin. "Here is a little boat," and he
        pushed aside the bushes behind which lay a
        rowboat with a pair of oars.</div>

    <p>As Puss got in, the Fox gave him some
        parting directions. "Follow the stream until
        you come to a lake. Then leave your boat
        and follow the right bank until you come to
        a bridge. After that you will find the highway
        which will take you to the castle of my
        Lord of Carabas, where your famous father,
        Puss in Boots, lives."</p>

    <p>"Thank you, my good friend," cried our
        little hero, pushing off from the shore, and
        in a few minutes he was gliding down the
        stream.</p>

    <p>"Heigh-ho!" he sighed.
        way to travel, but I have had many experiences,
        so why not a rowboat instead of a
        gander or an automobile," and he bent to
        his rowing and by and by he came to a bend
        in the river, and as it was late in the afternoon,
        he decided to land and camp for the
        night. But no sooner had he landed on the
        bank than a large turtle came up to him and
        said:</p>

    <p>"This is Turtle Island. No one is allowed
        to land unless he has a permit." Of course,
        little Puss, Junior, didn't have one, but after
        a moment's reflection, he said:</p>

    <p>"I am about to visit my father, the famous
        Puss in Boots, and if I cannot remain here
        for the night, I may have an accident on the
        river. Please let me stay."</p>

    <p>"Very well," said the Turtle, scratching
        his head, "you may remain on my island,"
        and then he crawled away to his own house
        on the hill, which Puss could see in the distance.
        I think the Turtle was a disagreeable
        sort of person not to have asked our little
        traveler to spend the night with him, but
        then, you know, there are some disagreeable
        people even in New Mother Goose Country,
        and the Turtle was one of them.
    <p>The next morning, bright and early, Puss,
        Junior, got up and cooked his breakfast, and
        then he jumped into his rowboat and started
        off and by and by, as he was gliding along,
        a big fish came up to the surface and said,
        "Helloa, there!" At first Puss was startled,
        for he didn't see the fish, but as soon as he
        did, he replied:</p>

    <p>"Don't get in my way! I might push my
        oar in your eye." This made the fish laugh so
        hard that he cried, and after that he laughed
        some more, only he didn't cry that time.
        "Where are you going?" he asked.</p>

    <p>"To the castle of my Lord of Carabas,"
        replied Puss.</p>

    <p>"A long journey, my brave little cat," said
        the fish, "but keep up a brave heart. You
        are already more than half way across New
        Mother Goose Country."</p>

    <h2>PUSS FINDS A SUPPER</h2>


    <div>FOR many days Puss, Junior, traveled in
        his boat down the river and towards
        evening he heard a voice on the shore singing:</div>

    <p>Of course this made our little traveler
        laugh, for he didn't know there was a Tammany
        Hall in New Mother Goose Country
        and neither did I until Puss told me.</p>

    <p>Well, he pulled his boat up on the bank
        and got out, and after that he listened again
        for the song, but there wasn't a sound, so
        he thought the baby must be asleep. Then
        he tiptoed over to a little cottage nearby and
        looked in the window. There sat a pretty
        little woman with a baby in her arms. And
        when she saw Puss she lifted her finger very
        gently to let him know that her baby was in
        the Land of Nod, and after that she placed
        him gently in the cradle.</p>

    <p>"Come in," she whispered to our little
        pussy cat traveler and when they were in the
        nice bright kitchen, for the fire in the stove
        made bright streaks of light over the clean
        floor, she said:</p>



    <p>"Sir Cat, you are a traveler, I see. Tell
        me one of your adventures while I get the
        supper. My good man will soon be home,
        hungry and tired from his day's work."</p>

    <p>Now Puss, Junior, was tired, too, and he
        didn't feel a bit like sitting down and telling
        a story. But he was an obliging little pussy
        and he knew, like Little Tommy Tucker,
        he must pay for his supper.</p>

    <p>"Once upon a time," he began, "there was
        a famous cat, and the reason he was so famous
        was because he had done a great favor
        for his master. You see, his master was the
        youngest of three sons, who, when his father
        died, got nothing but the cat, while the others
        got the farm and the money. But he never
        complained, which so pleased the cat that he
        made up his mind to help his young master.
        And what do you think he did? One day
        his master's clothes were stolen while in bathing,
        and the king, who was passing by at that
        moment in his coach, felt so sorry that he
        gave the young man a beautiful suit and
        asked him to drive with him. Of course the
        cat went, too, and as they passed along he
        waved his paw and said, 'All these lands
        belong to my master.' By and by they came
        to a castle where lived a giant. So the cat
        ran ahead, and said to the giant, who was
        sitting in his big room; 'I hear you can change
        yourself into anything. Let me see if you
        can turn into a mouse!' 'That's easy!'
        laughed the foolish giant. Whereupon this
        wise cat ate him up. And when the king
        arrived, he said, 'Here is my master's castle;'
        which so pleased the king that he gave his
        daughter to wed and the young man never
        forgot how his cat helped him to fame and
        fortune. And this cat is my father," concluded
        little Puss, Junior, with a bow.</p>

    <h2>ARKVILLE</h2>


    <div>THE next morning when Puss, Junior,
        went down to the river, he found his
        boat was gone.</div>


    <p>"Now I must trust again to my red-topped
        boots," he sighed, and at once set off to find
        his dear father. By and by he saw a little
        man in the distance, who, on coming nearer,
        turned out to be Tom Thumb.

    <p>Puss picked him up and placing him on his
        shoulder, set off once more. But, goodness
        me! It soon began to rain, and Tom Thumb
        crept into a pocket to keep dry.</p>

    <p>Towards the middle of the day they
        arrived on the outskirts of a small village.
        In the distance they could hear the strokes
        of a hammer, and then, now and again, the
        whirr of a saw cutting into hard wood.</p>

    <p>"What's going on, I wonder?" said Tom
        Thumb; "sounds as if they were building a
        house."</p>

    <p>"Don't know," answered Puss, "but let's
        hurry, for I am soaked to the skin."</p>

    <p>On arriving in the village they saw what
        appeared to be an immense boat in the early
        stages of construction. It was being erected
        in the city square, the little park that stood
        in the midst of the stores and houses.</p>

    <p>Drawing nearer they heard a voice singing:</p>

    <p>When Puss and Tom halted at the side
        of the Ark a kind-looking man stopped his
        hammering and said:</p>

    <p>"It's going to rain for forty days and
        forty nights. There's going to be an awful
        deluge. You'd better stay in Arkville and
        get aboard the Ark as soon as it's finished.
        If you don't you'll get drowned."</p>

    <p>"He speaks the truth, I'm thinking,"
        answered Tom Thumb, peeping out of Puss,
        Junior's, pocket. "It looks to me as if the
        rain were never going to stop."</p>

    <p>"My good sir," said Puss, turning to the
        man, "it seems to me your advice is good.
        We'll stay in Arkville for a few days. But
        where shall we stop? Is there a hotel near?"</p>

    <p>"Over yonder is the Hotel Ark," said the
        man. "I'm the proprietor, and my name is
        Noah. Go in and make yourselves at home.
        My sons and I will follow you shortly. We
        have a few more nails to drive before we quit
        for the day."</p>

    <h2>HOTEL ARK</h2>


    <div>THE Hotel Ark was a comfortable sort
        of a place, not very up-to-date, but with
        enough conveniences to make the traveler
        perfectly at home. He felt even more so
        after meeting the proprietor's wife, Mrs.
        Noah, a motherly-looking woman, with kind
        blue eyes and red cheeks.</div>

    <p>"Come right in," she said as Puss, Junior,
        and Tom Thumb, both wet to the skin,
        rapped on the door.</p>

    <p>"You'd best dry yourselves in the kitchen,"
        she said, leading them down a narrow hall.
        "It's so warm in there you'll be dry in no
        time."</p>

    <p>This was good news to our two small travelers,
        for their teeth were chattering like
        twenty-four small white horses on a red hill.</p>

    <p>"Here's a chair for you and here's a chair
        for Tom Thumb," said Mrs. Noah. "I'm
        not sure about your name, but I can't mistake
        that of your little friend." Puss, Junior,
        turned and bowed. Although he was wet, he
        did not forget his manners. "My name is
        Puss in Boots, Junior."</p>

    <p>"To be sure, to be sure," cried Mrs. Noah,
        "I might have known it."</p>

    <p>The kitchen fire was burning merrily,
        bright flames shot up the chimney and sparks
        from the wood flew out like stars upon the
        polished floor. Puss pulled off his dripping
        hat and laid it down on the chair. The
        feather was much bedraggled and had lost its
        wave. Tom Thumb undid his coat and hung
        it up, and then took off his shoes and placed
        them close to the hearth.</p>

    <p>"I think my boots are half full of water,"
        said Puss, Junior; "they are as heavy as
        lead, and when I walk they make a funny
        noise." They certainly were full of water,
        for when Puss finally got them off and turned
        them over, a stream of water ran down the
        floor, nearly washing Tom Thumb across the
        room.</p>

    <p>By the time their clothes were dry, Noah
        and his three sons arrived for supper.</p>

    <p>"Still raining!" said the good man, as he
        closed the door. "I must finish the Ark
        to-morrow. We may find a lake around the
        hotel by the morning. Who can tell? But
        I shall be ready to take in all the animals and
        my family by noon at the latest."</p>

    <h2>ALL ABOARD</h2>

    <div>IT was still raining when Puss, Junior, and
        Tom Thumb awoke. They had spent a
        comfortable night at the Hotel Ark and felt
        much refreshed. After a hearty breakfast
        they again looked out of the window. The
        rain was still coming down in torrents, and
        water lay inches deep upon the street. The
        Hotel Ark was surrounded by a shallow lake
        which, however, was growing deeper every
        minute.</div>

    <p>Puss, Junior, stepped out upon the veranda
        and looked over the village square.
        Through the rain he could make out the outlines
        of the Ark. Just then a voice began to
        sing:</p>

    <p>Pretty soon Noah himself came splashing
        through the water toward the hotel.</p>

    <p>"There is no time to lose," he cried, "the
        Ark will soon be afloat. Mother, make haste.
        Tell the girls to come along. We've no time
        to lose." Mrs. Noah appeared almost immediately,
        followed by the wives of her three
        sons. Lifting up their skirts, they waded
        after Noah. Puss, Junior, picked up Tom
        Thumb and placed him on his shoulder.
        From far and near, from the forest and the
        plain, from everywhere, the animals came
        hurrying up.</p>

    <p>"This reminds me of the circus," laughed
        Puss, Junior. "I once was with a circus;
        three days or so; whenever I see an elephant
        I think of my circus days."</p>

    <p>"Let down the gang-plank," commanded
        Noah, and soon a long procession of animals
        began to enter the Ark. The rain kept up
        was waist deep. All the smaller animals had
        come aboard and Captain Noah (as he was
        now called) felt certain by evening he would
        be able to start on his voyage.</p>

    <h2>PRECIOUS MOTHER GOOSE</h2>


    <div>AS the last animal came on deck and the
        Noah boys hauled in the gang-plank,
        the ark began rolling heavily, for the wind
        was high and the water rough. "Are we
        sure every one is aboard?" asked Captain
        Noah,</div>

    <p>If there was anyone more delighted than
        Puss, Junior, he could not be found aboard
        the Ark. To once more see Mother Goose
        who had so kindly carried him on her Gander
        many miles filled him with delight. He ran
        forward to greet her as she alighted from her
        faithful Gander.</p>

    <p>"Mother Goose! Mother Goose!" cried
        Puss, "I'm so glad to see you again."</p>

    <p>"Let us go in. It's getting dreadfully wet
        outside," she replied giving him a big hug.</p>

    <p>Inside the cabin all was dry and cheerful.
        Mrs. Noah had the stove burning brightly
        and her three daughter-in-laws were busy;
        getting supper.</p>

    <p>"Let me take your bonnet," said Mrs.
        Noah and before that dear old lady could
        remove her headgear, Mrs. Noah had taken
        out the big pin and undone the strings.</p>

    <p>"There, make yourself comfortable," she
        cried, pushing forward a rocking-chair.
        "And have you found your father?" asked
        the Gander, for he and Puss were having a
        fine time talking over old times.</p>

    <p>"No, not yet," answered Puss sadly, "But
        I hear he is Seneschal at the castle of my
        Lord of Carabas."</p>

    <p>"You must be patient," answered the Gander.
        "And go in search of more adventures."</p>

    <p>"Yes," answered Puss, "and I have with
        me my good comrade, Tom Thumb."</p>

    <p>"All ashore that's going ashore," shouted
        the hoarse voice of Captain Noah. Then
        came the tinkle-jingle of the bell and the Ark
        quivered from bow to stern, and in another
        moment was off on the dark waters.</p>

    <h2>CAPTAIN NOAH</h2>


    <div>THE first night on the Ark was most
        uncomfortable. It was not an easy
        thing to provide sleeping quarters for the
        animals, and although Captain Noah and his
        three sons did their best, from the complaints
        that were heard in the morning, it was easy to
        see that very few were satisfied.</div>

    <p>"We must get up a set of rules and regulations,"
        said Captain Noah at the breakfast
        table. "It's all very well to carry a cargo of
        coal or salt but when it comes to animals it's
        quite another thing. Each animal is so
        blamed different," and Captain Noah heaved
        a great sigh as he lifted the steaming cup of
        coffee to his lips.</p>

    <p>Puss, Junior, and Tom Thumb had risen
        with the sun&mdash;that is, I should say, at an
        early hour, for of course there was no sun.
        No, indeed, there was nothing but rain and
        a wide expanse of water. Water, water,
        everywhere, but not a speck of dirt. The
        whole world seemed nothing but water. The
        only thing that wasn't water was the Ark and
        its passengers.</p>

    <p>However, this did not keep Puss, Junior,
        and Tom Thumb from eating a hearty breakfast.
        They were good travelers, whether by
        land or sea, and to Puss, who had passed
        through many a dangerous adventure, the
        present situation seemed one of great interest.</p>

    <p>Mother Goose was also in high spirits.
        Turning to Captain Noah, she said:</p>

    <p>"My dear Captain, if it weren't for you, I
        hardly know what in the world I should have
        done. To fly on gander-back through the
        rain for forty days and nights would be
        impossible, so I have you to thank for my
        deliverance."</p>

    <p>"Don't mention it, my dear Mother
        Goose," replied Captain Noah. "I did only
        what was my duty. You know, I have
        always been the Weatherman of Arkville,
        and, if I do say it, I have hit the mark every
        time. I knew, in fact, I felt, that we were to
        have forty days and forty nights of rain.
        For the last two weeks I have published this
        in the Arkville News. To have the Ark finished
        in time was my greatest ambition, and
        now to reach Mount Ararat will be the
        crowning joy of my career.</p>


    <p>"I've so often heard that song at the Minstrels,"
        said Mother Goose, "that I believe
        it's really coming true."</p>

    <h2>FORTY DAYS AND FORTY NIGHTS</h2>


    <div>THE Ark was an exceedingly good sea
        craft. It rode the waves and breasted
        the gale without a mishap. Some of the animals
        became sea sick. But this, of course,
        was to be expected. Even Captain Noah
        himself felt rather queer at times, and as for
        little Tom Thumb, he kept to his bed for almost
        a week. Puss, Junior, proved to be a
        very fine sailor. Not once did he feel the
        least bit ill, and was able to help Mrs. Noah
        attend to the sick passengers.</div>

    <p>Of all the animals, however, the elephant
        was the most sea sick.</p>

    <p>"Of course, it had to be the biggest animal!"
        said Captain Noah at breakfast one
        morning. "Too bad, my dear," turning to
        Mrs. Noah, "that you have such an unwieldy
        patient on your hands." Mrs. Noah only
        smiled.</p>

    <p>"He does very little complaining," replied
        Mrs. Noah, "that is one thing to be thankful
        for. Now, take the little black ant. She
        does nothing but complain all the time. I'd
        rather attend to the elephant ten times over."</p>

    <p>"Well, mother, you always had something
        to be thankful for at the Ark Hotel. I'm
        glad that on board the Ark you still keep
        your cheerful disposition!" answered Captain
        Noah.</p>

    <p>But, oh, dear me! Pretty soon Puss,
        Junior, and Tom Thumb wondered if the
        forty days and forty nights would ever end
        and if the rain would ever stop. At last, one
        day, it seemed as if the sun were trying to
        break through the clouds. And then, all of
        a sudden, the rain ceased, and in the distance
        the dim outline of a mountain appeared
        through the mist.</p>

    <p>At once the animals began to sing:</p>

    <p>As if in obedience to the words of the song
        the Ark grounded, the sun came out from the
        clouds, and every one knew the voyage was at
        an end, for</p>

    <p>In a few minutes the gang-plank was lowered
        and the animals landed. Captain Noah
        was the last to leave.</p>

    <p>"Well," he exclaimed, "we have passed
        through an awful lot. But we're safe on
        land again." "Hurrah!" shouted all the animals,
        "we're safe at last!"</p>




    <h2>UP AND DOWN</h2>

    <p>It was the day of the county fair. Puss,
        Junior, had bought his ticket and stood looking
        about him uncertain what to do.</p>

    <p>"They say the balloon has gone up to the
        moon," cried the crowd.</p>

    <p>"Why, I've been up to the moon," said
        Puss, Junior, "but never will I get excited
        over that?" But, nevertheless, he walked up
        to the balloon man and asked. "When does
        your next balloon go up?"</p>

    <p>"In about five minutes," replied the owner
        of the air craft. "We have an ascension
        every half hour."</p>

    <p>"Well," replied our little hero, "I would
        like to be one of your passengers!"</p>

    <p>"Pay your shilling and you shall have a
        seat in the basket," answered the owner.</p>



    <p>After waiting for perhaps an hour the
        basket car was filled. My, how the people
        cheered as the balloon ascended, and when it
        had almost reached the clouds Puss leaned
        over the edge of the basket and threw little
        notes down to the people below. "Tell my
        good friends that Puss in Boots, Junior, has
        gone up in a balloon," he wrote on one of
        them.</p>

    <p>On another, he scribbled, "Puss in Boots,
        Junior, is about to visit the Man in the
        Moon."</p>

    <p>"You had better be careful," said the owner
        of the balloon, "how do I know we'll reach
        the moon?"</p>

    <p>"If you follow my directions you will,"
        replied Puss, Junior, "for I have been there
        before and, to tell you the truth, it is a most
        remarkable place. The moon is an unexplored
        country."</p>

    <p>"Well, I'll take your word for it," said the
        navigator of the balloon express. "I don't
        know much about these sky roads, but if
        you'll kindly consent to tell me where to steer
        my air craft, perhaps we'll reach the moon
        without a mishap."</p>

    <p>"Trust to me," said Puss, Junior, "for I
        have traveled far and if I don't know the
        way to the moon, my name is not Puss in
        Boots, Junior."</p>

    <p>So the owner of the balloon steered the big
        air craft straight up to the sky. Oh, dear
        me! But strange things will happen! For
        as they were sailing along as smoothly as
        and the balloon, instead of pointing for the
        big, round moon that shone like a silver dollar
        overhead, suddenly swerved to one side and
        before anyone could say "Jack Robinson"
        there was a dreadful explosion and Puss and
        his fellow passengers found themselves falling
        to the earth.</p>

    <p>"Good gracious!" exclaimed Puss. "What's
        the matter?"</p>

    <p>Before his question was answered the balloon
        crashed into a big willow tree.</p>

    <h2>ROCK-A-BY</h2>


    <div>IT was lucky that the balloon fell into the
        big willow tree, as I mentioned in the last
        story, for otherwise Puss, Junior, and his fellow
        passengers might have been badly hurt.
        As it happened, they were none the worse
        except for a few scratches. Puss pulled himself
        together and after arranging his clothes,
        which were torn and mussed by the branches
        of the tree, looked about him. Suddenly,
        he heard the cry of a baby, and turning
        around, he saw a little cradle swinging back
        and forth. It was fastened securely to a
        limb, and rocked to and fro as the breeze blew
        through the trembling leaves.</div>

    <p>"S-s-sh!" cried the balloon man, "We will
        wake the baby if we are not careful."</p>

    <p>"Won't it be sad if the bough breaks," said
        Puss, Junior, "it will be almost as bad for the
        baby as it was for us when the balloon fell
        into this tree."</p>

    <p>"It might be worse," said one of the passengers,
        who stood near them on a limb, looking
        anxiously to the ground.</p>

    <p>"Suppose we take down the cradle," said
        the balloon man.</p>

    <p>"Somebody must have hung it up here,"
        said Puss, "we have no right to take it down;
        it's not our baby."</p>

    <p>"You are perfectly right," said another
        passenger. "It isn't our cradle and it isn't
        our baby, so the best thing for us to do is to
        leave the cradle and climb down."</p>

    <p>As soon as the passengers were once more
        upon the ground they demanded their fare
        back, saying that they had paid for a trip
        to the moon, and not for a fall into a willow
        tree.</p>

    <p>"This doesn't seem quite fair to me,"
        remarked the balloon man, looking ruefully
        at his wrecked balloon. "I don't think I
        should give you back more than half, for the
        first part of the journey was successful."</p>

    <p>"You didn't keep to your bargain," cried
        Puss, stoutly; "and besides, you endangered
        our lives. I don't want to pay to go up in
        the air a little way and then be hurled down
        into a willow tree; it takes all the niceness out
        of the way up and makes the way down too
        dangerous."</p>

    <p>So the balloon man paid back the money
        and turned away. "Why don't you take the
        basket car with you?" asked Puss, Junior.</p>

    <p>"It's too big to carry," replied the balloon
        man. "I'll come around for it to-morrow
        with a horse and wagon."</p>

    <p>Pretty soon all the passengers had gone,
        leaving Puss alone under the willow tree.
        All of a sudden the baby began to cry, so
        Puss sang softly:</p>

    <div>
        "Hush-a-by, baby, upon the tree top,<br />
    </div>

    <p>And then the baby stopped crying, so Puss
        turned away and entered the old mill that
        stood in the shade of the old willow tree.</p>


    <h2>THE ROCK-A-BY BABY</h2>


    <div>"WELCOME, Sir Cat," said the dusty
        miller. "Sit down and tell me the
        news." But just then a sweet voice commenced
        to sing:</div>

    <div>
        Down in the village all the long day<br />
        Mother's been toiling the hours away;<br />
        While up in the tree-top beneath the blue sky<br />
        Baby has rocked to the wind's lullaby.<br />
        <br />
        Waiting is over, my sweet little one,<br />
        Mother is here for her own blue-eyed son.<br />
        Home we will go, and baby shall rest,<br />
        All the night through on mother's warm breast.<br />
    </div>

    <p>"Dearie me," suddenly exclaimed the
        dusty miller, "how tired she looks," and he
        walked to the door.</p>

    <p>"Let me carry the cradle," said Puss, and
        lifting it on his shoulder, followed the grateful
        little woman down the road.</p>

    <p>When they reached the house Puss was
        tired, for the cradle was heavy, and had nearly
        slipped off his shoulder two or three times,
        and once, when the baby caught hold of it,
        Puss nearly stumbled.</p>

    <p>"Come and rest," said the baby's mother,
        opening the little wicket gate in the white
        fence. Puss looked up at the pretty porch,
        covered with a honeysuckle vine. "Thank
        you," he answered, "I will," and he set the
        cradle down on the floor.</p>

    <p>"Please look after the baby," said the little
        mother, "while I get the supper?"</p>

    <p>"I'll try," said Puss, "but I'm not used to
        babies, and perhaps he'll roll off the porch."</p>

    <p>"Oh, you can keep him from doing that,"
        replied the little mother, "he's the best baby
        in the world!" So Puss sat down and played
        with him for almost half an hour. By and
        by a little bird began to sing:</p>

    <p>Pretty soon after that the little mother carried
        the baby into the house.</p>

    <p>Puss followed her into a cozy room, where,
        on the mantlepiece, stood a tick-tocky clock,
        just striking six. The tablecloth was spread
        and everything was ready for supper. Over
        in the corner hung a cage, in which sat a big
        green parrot.</p>

    <p>"Polly want a cracker?" asked Puss.</p>

    <p>"No, I don't want a cracker," replied the
        parrot; "I want a little mouse."</p>

    <p>"What!" cried Puss, "you don't mean to
        say you don't like crackers?"</p>

    <p>"I'm tired of them," said the parrot.</p>

    <p>"Did you ever eat a raisin cracker?" said
        Puss, with a grin.</p>

    <p>But the parrot didn't reply. Pretty soon
        he opened the door of his cage and came out.
        Puss was all alone in the room, for the mother
        had taken the baby upstairs.</p>

    <p>"I'm going to fly out of the window,"
        exclaimed the parrot. "I'm tired being
        alone all day in this house." And before
        Puss could stop him, he opened the window
        and flew away.</p>

    <p>"The parrot's gone!" cried Puss running
        to the foot of the stairs. Then he rushed out
        into the yard and found the parrot perched
        on the limb of an old apple tree.</p>

    <p>"I won't come back!" he cried. "I won't!"</p>

    <h2>SAILORS TWO</h2>


    <p>Now as soon as the old woman who lived
        next door saw Puss, Junior, climb the tree
        to catch the parrot who had flown out of the
        window, she cried, "Don't let the pussy cat
        get you, Polly."</p>

    <p>But goodness me! As soon as the old
        woman's parrot heard that he was up in the
        tree with the other parrot, and then they both
        began to scream, "I won't come back! I
        won't come back!"</p>

    <p>"I don't care what they do," said the old
        woman, "I'd much rather have a cat for a pet
        than a parrot, anyway. He has been a
        dreadful care ever since my son, who is a
        sailor, brought him home."</p>

    <p>So Puss looked down from the tree and
        said, "Then would you rather I didn't catch
        your parrot?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, let him go," said the old woman.</p>

    <p>"But I must catch the other one," said
        Puss.</p>

    <p>"Well, you'll have to get a pair of wings,
        my dear Sir Cat," cried the parrot. "You
        may be Puss in Boots, Junior, but you can't
        fly. So I bid you farewell," and away he
        flew, and then the old woman's parrot clapped
        his wings and followed him.</p>



    <p>So there was nothing for Puss to do but
        come down from the tree. And then all of a
        sudden the old woman cried, "Why, here
        comes my son," and a sailor boy jumped
        over the fence and threw his arms around her.</p>

    <p>"My ship just got in to-day, mother," he
        cried, giving her a big hug. And after that
        he looked at Puss, and said, "Shiver my timbers,
        but that's a fine cat you have, mother."</p>

    <p>"He's not mine," answered the old woman,
        "but I wish he would stay with us, my parrot
        has just flown away."</p>

    <p>"Thank you, madam," said Puss, "but I
        must be on my way to find my father, Puss
        in Boots."</p>

    <p>"We sail to-morrow," said the sailor boy,
        "why don't you come aboard ship? You'll
        have a fine trip, and maybe you'll find your
        father at the first sea-port we reach."</p>

    <p>"Good idea," cried Puss, "I'll go with
        you."</p>

    <p>"All right, my hearty," cried the sailor
        boy, slapping Puss on the back, "you and I
        will be pals. A sailor's life is the life for me."</p>

    <p>"Then I'll be a sailor, too," cried Puss,
        "and to-morrow we will sail the ocean blue."</p>




    <h2>A WONDERFUL SHIP</h2>

    <p>"Hurrah!" cried Puss, Junior, "A sailor's
        life is the life for me." The good ship was
        at the dock, and her crew of sailor boys were
        ready to cast off the mooring lines. Puss,
        Junior, had been promised a sailor-suit as
        soon as the ship's tailor had the time to
        make it.</p>

    <p>Just then the little woman who hung her
        baby's cradle on the willow tree by the old
        mill, came walking down to the dock.</p>

    <p>"Are you going, too?" asked Puss, helping
        her with the cradle, for she had walked a
        long way and was very tired.</p>

    <p>"Yes, indeed," she replied, "because it's
        full of pretty things for baby and for me."</p>

    <p>"How jolly!" cried Puss, dancing about
        on his toes. "We'll have a fine trip."</p>

    <p>"That's what the 'rusty, dusty' miller said,"
        cried the baby's mother. "He told me this
        morning when I put the cradle in the 'Rock-a-by'
        willow tree that the ship was sailing
        to-day and that they needed a cook; so I'm
        going to ask the Captain if I may cook and
        bake for you all. I know how to make the
        nicest cookies you ever ate. You just wait
        and see what nice things we will have to eat."</p>

    <p>Then Puss helped her over the gang-plank,
        for the crew was busy loading the good ship
        with all kinds of things.</p>

    <p>Pretty soon the miller came running down
        the dock. "Here is a sack of flour," he
        panted, "I thought you might need some for
        muffins."</p>

    <p>"Isn't that fine?" said Puss, leaning over
        the rail. "There's nothing like having plenty
        of food aboard in case the voyage is a long
        one."</p>

    <p>"I don't know where we are bound," said
        the baby's mother, "but baby will like it, I'm
        sure. One can 'rock-a-by baby' on the sea as
        well as on the old willow tree."</p>

    <p>"I heard," said the 'rusty, dusty' miller,
        as he laid the heavy sack of flour on the deck,
        and wiped the perspiration from his forehead,
        "that</p>

    <p>"Why, so they are," cried Puss, gazing
        up at the beautiful tall shining masts. "They
        are of gold, of course they are. Look, baby,"
        he cried, "see the gold masts."</p>

    <p>"He's too young to know whether they
        are made of gold or good old oak," said his
        mother, "but we'll teach him to be a good
        sailor, won't we, Puss, dear?"</p>

    <h2>ALL ABOARD!</h2>


    <div>"ALL aboard!" shouted the Captain.</div>

    <p>"There's a locket fastened to every chain,"
        cried Puss. "What pretty lockets."</p>

    <p>"Each little sailor mouse has a picture of
        his mother in his locket," said the Captain,
        who stood near by giving the orders. Now,</p>

    <p>"Hello!" said Puss, Junior, stretching out
        his right paw. "Hello, Captain! Aren't you
        the duck that took me across the pond on
        your back a long, long time ago. You told
        me about your cousin, the Golden Goose,
        don't you remember?"</p>

    <p>"So I did," said the Captain, looking Puss
        over. "Shiver my timbers if you're not Puss,
        Junior!"</p>

    <p>"The very same," replied Puss.</p>

    <p>"And haven't you found your daddy yet?"
        asked the Captain as his good ship swung
        away from the dock, her silk sails filling with
        the breeze until they looked like great big
        balloons cut in half.</p>

    <p>"No, Captain," replied Puss, sadly, "I
        haven't."</p>

    <p>"Well, we'll ask for him at every port,"
        replied the kind master of the good ship,
        which was now rolling and dipping in the
        most graceful way possible. "I'll ask every
        old land lubber on the docks when we touch
        port. We'll hear some news, never fear."
        And then the Captain went over to tell the
        man at the tiller where to go. The "man" at
        the wheel was a little white mouse, but he
        knew how to steer the ship as well as any
        pilot, let me tell you.</p>

    <p>"I don't have to rock the cradle," said the
        baby's mother, with a smile, looking up at
        Puss, as he tip-toed over to where she sat.</p>

    <p>"No, he's fast asleep," replied Puss, "and
        the big blue ocean is rocking him better than
        the willow tree."</p>
    <p>"Where did you hear that pretty song?"
        asked Puss.</p>

    <p>"Why, I just made it up," replied the
        baby's mother.</p>

    <p>"Mothers always do that when they rock
        their little ones to sleep, you know."</p>

    <h2>OLD TOM</h2>


    <div>THE next morning the good ship came
        in sight of an old seaport. The harbor
        was very safe, for a tall white lighthouse
        stood upon the rocks to guide the sailors, and
        bellbuoys clanged their solemn warning from
        the dangerous reefs. In the distance rose a
        church spire, and near it stood a little red
        schoolhouse with a flag flying in the breeze.
        Down on the wharf ran a low row of buildings,
        worn and battered, where the old sailors
        lounged and told stories of their early
        days.</div>

    <p>Pretty soon the good ship came about, and
        with her silken sails flapping in the wind,
        drifted up to the dock.</p>

    <p>"Make fast!" shouted the Captain. The
        four and twenty little sailor mice jumped
        nimbly on the dock, and in a few minutes
        made the silk ropes fast to the posts. Then
        the good ship came to a standstill, and the
        gang-plank was lowered.</p>

    <p>"All ashore that's going ashore!" quacked
        the captain.</p>

    <p>"Oh Captain Duck," cried Puss, Junior,
        "we don't have to land, do we?"</p>

    <p>"No," replied the Duck. "But you may
        go ashore for a little while if you wish. We
        don't sail for two hours."</p>

    <p>"All right!" replied Puss, "I'll take a
        run on the grass," and he walked down the
        gang-plank across the old wharf, until he
        came to a path, well worn by the sailors who
        for years had carried the cargoes up to the
        little village. Under a tree close by sat an
        old sailor. He was smoking a big black
        pipe as contentedly as could be. But as
        soon as he saw Puss he took it out of his
        mouth.</p>

    <p>"Ahoy, my breezy little reefer," he cried.</p>

    <p>"Good morning," replied Puss.</p>

    <p>"Don't be in a hurry," said the old sailor.
        "Just moor your little hulk alongside of old
        Tom."</p>

    <p>"What's the matter, my breezy little skipper?"
        asked the old sailor after a few minutes
        silence, for, Puss, you see, didn't know what
        to say.</p>

    <p>"Nothing," replied Puss, sadly, "only, I
        can't find my father, the famous Puss in
        Boots."</p>

    <p>"What did he look like?" asked the old
        sailor, with a grin.</p>

    <p>"He looked like me&mdash;&mdash;or, rather, I look
        like him," replied Puss.</p>

    <p>"Well, my merry little sandpiper!" cried
        the old salt, "you should have stayed at
        home!"</p>

    <p>"I don't agree with you," said Puss stoutly,
        "I wanted to see the world."</p>

    <p>"Give me your flipper," said the old sailor
        kindly. "Good luck to ye. I hope you find
        your daddy."</p>

    <h2>A NEW PASSENGER</h2>


    <div>PUSS, JUNIOR, waved his paw to the
        old sailor, who put his pipe back in his
        mouth and smoked away contentedly under
        the shady tree. All of a sudden a pretty
        little girl jumped out from behind a stone
        wall.</div>

    <p>"Hello," said Puss when she had finished
        her song.</p>

    <p>"Did you just get off that pretty ship,"
        she asked.</p>

    <p>"Yes, Miss," replied Puss.</p>

    <p>"Was Bobby Shafto on board?"</p>

    <p>"I didn't see him," replied Puss. "Did
        you expect him?"</p>

    <p>"I don't know," replied the little girl, "but
        I run down to look every time a ship comes
        to the old dock. And I always ask the old
        sailor who sits on the bench over there if he
        has seen my Bobby."</p>

    <p>"You're looking for your Bobby, and I'm
        searching for my daddy," said Puss, sadly.
        And then he told the little girl how discouraged
        he was because in all his travels he had
        not yet found him.</p>

    <p>And then, all of a sudden, they heard a
        voice calling, "All aboard!"</p>

    <p>"Goodness!" exclaimed Puss, "I must
        hurry; the ship's going to sail. Good-by!"
        and off he ran to the dock as fast as he could.</p>

    <p>"Wait for me," called out the little girl,
        "I guess I'll go, too. I may find Bobby
        Shafto."</p>

    <p>"Hurry, hurry!" cried Puss, looking back.
        "I'll run ahead and ask the Captain to wait."</p>

    <p>And it was lucky he did, for the gang-plank
        was being hauled in just as he arrived.
        "Wait for us!" he shouted.</p>

    <p>"Why, I don't see anybody else," said the
        Captain, as Puss stepped aboard.</p>

    <p>"Yes, there is," answered Puss, "There
        she comes!"</p>

    <p>And in another minute, with her bonnet
        strings streaming in the wind, the little girl
        came running down the dock.</p>

    <p>"Thank you for waiting," she cried, turning
        to the Captain. "I'd have been so
        disappointed if you had left me behind."</p>

    <p>And then she stood close to Puss as the
        good ship left the dock. "Good luck, my
        little skipper," shouted the old sailor.</p>

    <p>"Good-by," cried Puss, waving his cap to
        the old salt.</p>

    <h2>OVER THE WATER</h2>


    <div>WHEN the old dock and the gray-haired
        sailor, the tall church spire
        and the flag on the little red schoolhouse were
        out of sight, Puss, Junior, turned to the little
        girl and said: "Let's go down in the cabin.
        I'll show you the cutest little baby you ever
        saw. It's the 'rock-a-by, baby, upon-the-tree-top.'
        His mother always hung the cradle on
        a willow tree so that the breeze might rock
        him to sleep. But now the ocean does the
        rocking and baby sleeps almost all the time."</div>

    <p>So the little girl followed Puss down the
        stairs to the cabin, where they heard a sweet
        voice singing:</p>

    <p>"S-s-sh!" said the mother of the baby as
        Puss and the little girl came in.</p>

    <p>"Are you going to make a cake with the

    <p>"S-s-sh!" said the mother of the baby as
        Puss and the little girl came in.</p>

    <p>"Are you going to make a cake with the
        flour the miller brought on board?" asked
        Puss in a whisper.</p>

    <p>"Yes," said the baby's mother. "But
        what's your name?" turning to the little girl.</p>

    <p>"She's looking for Bobby Shafto," answered
        Puss.</p>

    <p>"What's your name, little girl," asked the
        rock-a-by-baby's mother.</p>

    <p>"Alice," said the little girl.</p>

    <p>"A pretty name."</p>

    <p>"I'm glad you like it," said the little girl.
        "And what is yours?"</p>

    <p>"Mine? Oh, you can call me 'The Rock-a-by
        Baby's Mother.'"</p>

    <p>"Let's go out on deck," suggested Puss.
        "Won't you come, too?" he asked, turning
        to the baby's mother.</p>

    <p>Rolling in the sea were huge black porpoises.
        Over and over they rolled like great
        footballs. Flying fish rose out of the water,
        and overhead the gulls sailed back and forth
        on their great wings. The breeze was blowing
        strong and steady, and now and then
        the salt spray came over the railing. Some
        of it wet Puss, Junior's, whiskers.</p>

    <p>"Did you get wet?" asked Alice.</p>

    <p>"Not much," said Puss. "Besides, I don't
        care for a little spray, anyway."</p>

    <p>"Come over here and sit down on this coil
        of rope," said the Rock-a-By-Baby's Mother,
        and I'll sing you a song:</p>

    <h2>CUSTARD AND MUSTARD</h2>


    <div>FOR several days the good ship, with the
        four and twenty sailor mice and the duck
        captain, sailed over the big blue sea. Puss,
        Junior, learned to climb the mast and to run
        out to the very tip of the great boom to tie a
        rope for Captain Duck when it was blowing
        a gale. The Rock-a-By-Baby's Mother
        made a most delicious cake with the flour
        which the 'rusty, dusty' miller had sent on
        board, and altogether it was a most enjoyable
        trip, and when the good ship put into port
        on the fifth day everybody was sorry.</div>

    <p>Even the little girl who was waiting for
        Bobby Shafto to come home told Puss she
        had forgotten all about him.</p>

    <p>Well, as soon as the ship was fast to the
        dock, Puss said good-by to Captain Duck
        and the sailor mice.</p>

    <p>"I hope Bobby Shafto will return soon,"
        he whispered to the little girl as he kissed
        her good-by.</p>

    <p>"I shall miss you very much," he said to
        the Rock-a-By-Baby's mother.</p>

    <p>"Will you, my dear Puss?" she answered,
        giving him a hug. "You're a dear little cat!
        I hope you soon find your father. When
        you do, tell him he has a fine little son&mdash;tell
        him that from me, won't you?"</p>

    <p>And after that Puss went upon his way,
        and by and by, after a while he found himself
        on a broad highway. "I wonder what
        will happen next?" he said to himself, and
        just then he came to a small house near the
        road. So he stopped at the front gate to
        listen to a sweet voice singing:</p>

    <p>Puss opened the gate and peeped through
        the window. In the centre of the room stood
        a small boy, wiping his eyes with a little pink
        handkerchief.</p>

    <p>"Nothing but mustard," repeated his
        mother, "if you don't stop crying."</p>

    <p>"Meow!" cried Puss at the window. "Won't
        you give me some custard?" And then, my
        goodness! didn't that little boy stop crying!</p>

    <p>"Look at the cat with boots on!" he cried,
        running up to the window.</p>

    <p>"You both shall have some custard," said
        Jack's mother, "and then you may go out to
        the swing and have a good time."</p>

    <p>Well, it didn't take long to eat the custard,
        and then Jacky and Puss went out under the
        big tree.</p>

    <div>sang Puss, Junior.</div>

    <p>"After supper, Jacky, I'll tell you how I
        was a sailor boy for almost a week on the
        ocean blue!"</p>

    <h2>ROWLEY FROG</h2>


    <div>NOW let me think what happened after
        Puss finished telling how he had been
        a sailor for a week on the ocean blue.</div>

    <p>Oh yes, of course. He had scarcely said
        good-by to the little boy when whom should
        he meet but Mr. Rowley Frog and a big rat.</p>

    <p>"So you're going to make a call on Mrs.
        Mousey," said Puss, as he and Mr. Rowley
        Frog and the rat reached the dusty highway.
    </p>

    <p>"Yes, sir-ee," replied Mr. Rowley Frog.
        "She lives just over there." And when Puss
        looked across the meadow he saw a cute little
        house.</p>

    <p>"Looks like a pretty nice little place," said
        the rat; "let's hurry along." So all three
        started off on a run.</p>

    <p>"I guess she's too busy," said Puss. "We'd
        better not interrupt her."</p>

    <p>"Nonsense," replied Mr. Rowley Frog,
        bowing to Mrs. Mousey, who happened just
        then to look out of her little window. Then
        Mr. Rat took off his cap and said:</p>

    <p>"Indeed, I will not," said Mrs. Mousey.
        "You ought to be ashamed of yourself! And
        as for Mr. Anthony Rowley, he must throw
        away that horrid cigar if he wants to call
        on me."</p>

    <p>Well, goodness gracious! Didn't Mr.
        Rowley look ashamed! He threw his cigar
        away at once, and Mr. Rat hid behind Puss,
        he was so embarrassed, and as soon as Mrs.
        Mousey saw that they were both truly sorry
        for what they had done, she smiled and said:</p>

    <p>But first she opened the door and invited
        them in. "I'm not afraid of you," she said
        to Puss, "for I know you are Mr. Puss in
        Boots, Junior."</p>

    <p>Well, just as soon as they were all seated,
        she began to sing:</p>

    <p>"I'll see that my two small friends behave,"
        said Puss, with a grin.</p>

    <h2>MRS. MOUSEY</h2>


    <div>"WHAT will you have?" Mrs. Mousey
        asked Puss, Junior, as she opened the
        cupboard door.</div>

    <p>"I'll have a strawberry ice-cream soda,"
        said Puss. So Mrs. Mousey poured some
        red syrup into the glass and dropped in a
        ball of ice cream, and after that she held the
        glass under a regular soda-fountain spigot
        which was fastened to a cute little ice-box.
        "Fiz-z-z, fiz-z-z!" went the water until the
        pink-colored foam almost ran over the edge
        of the glass. But it didn't. Wasn't that
        lucky?</p>

    <p>"I'll take a pink and white peppermint
        stick," said Mr. Rowley Frog, and Mr. Rat
        said, "Cheese, if you please!" when Mrs.
        Mousey asked him what he would have.</p>

    <p>And, oh dear me! Puss dropped his soda-water
        glass, and it broke all to smithereens.
        And then,</p>

    <p>And after that the cat jumped through
        the open window with the rat and disappeared
        around the house, and the kittens ran out of
        the door with poor Mrs. Mouse.</p>

    <p>Puss jumped through the window, but before
        he could catch them they ran into a hole
        just big enough for them to squeeze through,
        and Puss was left outside, wondering what to
        do. The old cat was nowhere to be seen.
        She had taken good care to get out of sight,
        for she knew that Puss, Junior, would take
        Mr. Rat away from her if he ever caught
        her.</p>

    <p>"I'll go home to mother," he said when he
        reached the roadway. "I am getting homesick.
        I think the old pond is the best place
        for me."</p>

    <p>"That's right," said Puss, as he hurried
        along with Rowley, who, now that he had
        made up his mind, could not get home fast
        enough.</p>

    <h2>A SAD ENDING</h2>


    <div>"I'M very sorry for poor little Mrs.
        Mousey," said Puss, as he and Mr.
        Rowley Frog hastened toward the pond.</div>

    <p>"So am I," answered Rowley. "She was
        very generous with all her good things to
        eat."</p>

    <p>"And the poor rat," continued Puss. "It
        was a sad ending to our little feast. I guess
        he's been eaten up by this time. That
        naughty old cat looked very hungry."</p>

    <p>"Oh dear, oh dear," sobbed Rowley, the
        tears rolling down his face, "I want to get
        home. I'll never run away again."</p>

    <p>"This is dreadful," cried Puss, as he saw
        his small friend disappear down the duck's
        long neck; "it has been a sad day. All three
        of my little friends are gone."</p>

    <p>"Never mind," cried the lily-white duck,
        looking up at Puss standing mournfully by
        the side of the brook, "Frogs are good to eat,
        and if they will run away from home, it's
        their own lookout. They should stay in their
        ponds and not go wandering about strange
        places."</p>

    <p>Puss did not answer. It seemed pretty
        hard to meet such a sad fate, and he did not
        like the lily-white duck at all.</p>

    <p>"Come, come," cried the duck, "cheer up,
        I'll ferry you across the brook if you wish
        to reach the other side."</p>

    <p>"That's kind of you," said Puss, seating
        himself on her back.</p>

    <p>"I'm not such a bad sort of duck," she continued,
        paddling swiftly toward the opposite
        bank, "but I must eat, and frogs are mighty
        good eating, let me tell you."</p>

    <p>As she finished speaking she waddled up
        the bank, and Puss sprang nimbly from her
        back. "Thank you, Mrs. Duck," he said,
        "indeed, I'm obliged to you; but I wish you
        hadn't eaten my friend, the little frog."</p>

    <p>Just then nine little yellow ducklings waddled
        toward them. "These are my children,"
        said Mrs. Duck, very proudly.</p>

    <p>"How are you, my little ducklets?" cried
        Puss.</p>

    <p>"Quite well, thank you," they answered.
        It was a pretty sight to see those yellow
        balls of down cuddle up to their mother, and
        Puss began to feel that, after all, she must
        be a good sort of duck, for her children loved
        her so much. Perhaps he had judged her
        too harshly for gobbling up the frog, and
        when she turned to Puss and said:</p>

    <p>"Come home with us, Mr. Puss," he forgave
        her for what she had done, and followed
        her downy, yellow brood.</p>

    <h2>BEAVER DAM</h2>

    <p>"Dear me," cried Puss to Mrs. Duck and
        he looked about him for the owner of the
        sad croaky voice. Pretty soon he saw a big
        bullfrog in a brook.</p>

    <p>"Come along with me," cried Puss, Junior.</p>

    <p>Just then a little muskrat jumped out of
        the water and from behind a tree ran a pretty
        gray squirrel and a striped chipmunk.</p>

    <p>"Did you call us?" they asked Puss all at
        once.</p>

    <p>"No, my little friends," he replied, "but
        come along," and when they reached Beaver
        Dam, they looked around to see what had
        become of the old bullfrog. There he was
        in the water about halfway down the stream,
        swimming away for all he was worth.</p>

    <p>"Ker-chunk, ker-chunk!" he cried, as he
        came up to them, "Why don't you wait for
        a fellow? And why didn't you tell me you
        were going up stream</p>

    <p>Puss, Junior, felt very sorry to think that
        he had really forgotten all about the old bullfrog.</p>

    <p>"Well, you got here all right, didn't you?"
        asked the muskrat. "Now," he continued,
        "I'm going to knock three times on the dam
        to let Mr. Beaver know that we would like
        to cross."</p>

    <p>After giving three loud knocks, Mr. Beaver
        looked over and said: "What's the matter?
        Who are you? What do you want? Where
        did you come from? Where are you going?"</p>

    <p>"We'll answer the last question first," said
        Puss, Junior, with a grin. "We'd like to
        cross over on your beautiful great big dam."</p>

    <p>"The toll is a penny," said the beaver,
        looking them over carefully.</p>

    <p>"I haven't got a penny with me," said the
        little squirrel, "but I have a dandy big nut,
        if that will do."</p>

    <p>"All right," said the beaver, "give me the
        nut." He put it in his pocket, remarking
        as he did so, "it looks like a good nut. I
        only hope I shall not be disappointed when
        I crack it."</p>

    <p>Turning to the chipmunk, he said, "What
        have you got?"</p>

    <p>"A little acorn," answered the chipmunk.</p>

    <p>"I don't want any more nuts," said the
        beaver, disgustedly. "I'm not particularly
        fond of nuts, anyway. I only took this one
        from the squirrel because I knew he didn't
        have anything else."</p>

    <p>"Here are two pennies, Mr. Beaver&mdash;one
        for Chipmunk and one for me," said Puss,
        Junior.</p>

    <p>"All right, Sir Cat," said the beaver,
        "walk across, but see that you do not slip,
        for the water is very deep on the upper side."</p>

    <p>Puss carefully wended his way over, followed
        by the little squirrel and the chipmunk.
        The old frog swam over, as did the muskrat.
        When they all reached the other side, Puss
        went forward, followed by his small comrades,
        who stretched out behind him like a
        funny little army.</p>

    <p>They hadn't gone very far, when a rabbit
        jumped out from behind a bush. Puss,
        Junior, called out, "Don't be frightened.
        We won't hurt you."</p>

    <p>"Baby!" cried the squirrel, "you're bigger
        than I am, but you're twice as much afraid."</p>

    <p>"I'm going to a wedding," said the rabbit.
        "I've no time to wait!" and away he went.
    </p>

    <p>"Gracious me!" exclaimed the squirrel.
        "I had forgotten all about Cock Robin's wedding!
        I must be going."</p>

    <p>"And so must I," cried the chipmunk and
        the beaver, but what the old bullfrog said I
        will tell you in the next story.</p>

    <h2>DUCKLINGS</h2>


    <div>WELL, you will certainly agree with
        me that the old bullfrog, in the last
        story, is a wonderful fellow when you hear
        what he says about Mrs. Duck, and, it is all
        in poetry, too.</div>

    <p>"So this is your home," said Puss, Junior,
        as Mrs. Duck stepped into her nest, followed
        by her brood.</p>

    <p>"What do you do when it rains?" asked
        Puss, Junior.</p>

    <p>"What do we do when it rains?" repeated
        Mrs. Duck, "why, what do you suppose a
        duck's feathers are good for? They shed the
        water as well as a barn roof. Yes, even better,
        for feathers are water-proof and shingles
        are not."</p>

    <p>"Well, my good Mrs. Duck, of course it's
        all right for you and your family, but should
        it rain, what would I do? I couldn't possibly
        crawl under your wings."</p>

    <p>"Not very well," laughed Mrs. Duck.</p>

    <p>"But it's not going to rain," cried one little
        duck, peering out from between her feathers.
        "I know it's not going to rain, for there isn't
        a cloud in the sky."</p>

    <p>Then all the little ducklings poked their
        heads out and cried, "It's not going to rain,
        it's not going to rain!"</p>

    <p>"If it should, and there's no telling lately,
        for the weather has been so unsettled, I could
        take you up to the barnyard and introduce
        you to Molly Head," said Mrs. Duck, turning
        to Puss, Junior. "She has charge of all
        the poultry and is a very kind woman, very
        kind indeed."</p>

    <p>"If I knew where to buy an umbrella,"
        said Puss, after a pause, "I wouldn't mind a
        little shower, but you know how a cat hates
        to get wet."</p>

    <p>"Yes, they make as much fuss over a little
        water as a hen does," laughed good Mrs.
        Duck.</p>

    <h2>A LESSON IN WADDLING</h2>


    <div>PUSS, JUNIOR, was very tired with
        his journey, so he cuddled up in the long
        grass close to Mrs. Duck's nest and he was
        soon fast asleep. Then Mrs. Duck tucked in
        her yellow ducklings and they were soon
        dreaming of nice fat worms and little silver
        fishes. By and by Mrs. Duck closed first
        one eye and then the other, and pretty soon
        she was asleep.</div>

    <p>The wind played little lullabys in the tall
        grass and the brook close by murmured over
        its pebbly bottom. The crickets in the
        meadow made sleepy little noises, so that it
        must have been over an hour before anybody
        woke up.</p>

    <p>"I'll play duck too," said Puss, jumping to
        his feet and imitating Mrs. Duck. The ducklings
        looked at Puss in wonder.</p>

    <p>"He'd make a fine duck," said one little
        duckling.</p>

    <p>"If he had feathers instead of fur," laughed
        Mrs. Duck.</p>

    <p>"If he had yellow stockings like ours," said
        another duckling, "instead of red-topped
        boots."</p>

    <p>"Stop your quacking," cried Mrs. Duck.
        "Did you hear what I said about waddling
        just now?"</p>

    <p>Puss, Junior, turned in his toes exactly the
        way they did, which made them laugh; even
        Mrs. Duck chuckled. "Look out," she cried,
        "or Puss, Junior, will do it better than you."</p>

    <p>"Thank you, ma'am," said Puss with a
        grin.</p>

    <p>"Won't you try to do better?" said Mrs.
        Duck, turning to her brood with an anxious
        expression on her kind face.</p>

    <p>"I wish I had a drum," cried Puss, "I'd
        beat time. We could make believe we were
        soldiers." But Mrs. Duck did not answer.
        "Do your best," she said to her little brood.</p>

    <p>"I wish I could swim," cried Puss; "it
        looks like great sport!"</p>

    <h2>HOW TO BE A DUCK</h2>

    <p>"See who can swim the fastest," cried Puss.
        "Why don't you have a race?" The nine
        little ducklings stopped.</p>

    <p>"Line up in a row," cried Puss, "and when
        I cry 'Go!' swim as fast as you can, and the
        one who reaches this bank first wins. I'll
        give a bright penny to the winner."</p>

    <p>All the ducklings arranged themselves in
        a row, and when Puss cried "One, two, three,
        go!" they paddled away as hard as they could.
        Back and forth went their little yellow feet.
        Such a splashing! Nearer and nearer they
        came. One little duck flapped his wings upon
        the water and in this way managed to get
        ahead. He was the first to land.</p>

    <p>"Here is your penny," cried Puss.</p>

    <p>"What can I do with it, mother?" he asked.</p>

    <p>"You can get a stick of candy to-morrow,"
        replied his mother. "Not this afternoon, for
        it is time now to go home to the farm.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Duck came out of the water and
        shook herself well, sending quite a shower of
        water in little drops all about her. Puss
        jumped back to avoid a shower bath. The
        ducklings stood up on their toes and flapped
        their small wings. Then off they all went,
        Mrs. Duck in the lead. Puss followed behind,
        taking care not to step on the yellow toes
        of the last duckling.</p>

    <p>As they neared the barnyard Mrs. Duck
        turned and said:</p>
    <p>The woman who took care of the poultry
        yard was already there. From a well filled
        pan she was scattering handfuls of corn in
        all directions. There were a great many
        chickens, who darted hither and thither, picking
        up the grains of corn. When the corn
        was all gone she set down a dish of food. No
        sooner had she done this than Mrs. Duck exclaimed</p>

    <p>"My, but she's a wise old duck," said Puss
        to himself with a grin.</p>

    <h2>"WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY"</h2>


    <div>IT was a queer looking house that Puss,
        Junior, saw in the distance. It seemed
        more like a box, with another little box tacked
        on, through the top of which rose a long
        piece of stove pipe, which, I suppose, served
        as a chimney, although chimneys are usually
        made of bricks in Old Mother Goose Country.</div>

    <p>On the front porch sat a little old man,
        smoking a pipe, from which the smoke drifted
        away in little gray clouds, while the smoke
        from the stovepipe chimney stretched out
        like a long black feather.</p>

    <p>"Good-day," said Puss, taking off his hat.</p>

    <p>"Come and rest beside me," said the old
        man, pushing forward an armchair. So Puss
        sat down, and after wiping the perspiration
        from his forehead remarked, "A warm day,
        my good sir."</p>

    <p>"Yes, indeed," replied the little old man,
        "but all days seem very much alike to me."</p>

    <p>"Do they?" asked Puss. "Why?"</p>

    <p>"Well, I'll tell you the story of my life,"
        said the little old man, and, taking his pipe
        from his lips, he began</p>

    <p>"And have you lived alone ever since?"
        asked Puss.</p>

    <p>"Yes," replied the old man, "and the mice
        and the rats give me no peace. They eat up
        all my cheese and flour."</p>

    <p>"I'll help you," said Puss. "Let me stay
        here to-night, and I'll catch every rat and
        mouse that bothers you inside the house."</p>

    <p>"You can make up poetry as well as I
        can," said the old man, with a laugh. "Why,
        that's the first laugh I've had in many a long
        year. I like you, Sir Cat. You are an obliging
        sort of person. You shall have the best
        that my small home affords. I only hope
        you will rid the place of rats and mice."</p>

    <p>"Leave that to me," replied Puss, with a
        grin.</p>

    <h2>GOOD RIDDANCE</h2>


    <div>NOW, let me see. In the last story we
        left little Puss, Junior, in the house of
        the old man who brought his wife home in a
        wheelbarrow. Well, Puss heard him take off
        his shoes and get into bed, and then out went
        the light. I guess the old man leaned out of
        bed and blew it out. But Puss didn't go to
        bed. Oh, my, no! He slipped off his red-topped
        boots, so as not to frighten the rats
        and the mice and stole softly over to the
        window. The moon was bright and the stars
        were twinkling in the sky.</div>

    <p>"It's a long time since I've been a mouser!"
        laughed Puss to himself. "I wonder if I
        have lost my cunning?" And he sat down
        by the window and crossed his leg over the
        other. "Not a creature was stirring, not even
        a mouse," and it was not the night before
        Christmas, either. Pretty soon the sound of
        scampering feet caught his ear, and, turning
        his head, he saw a dozen mice or more running
        over the floor, and after that two big
        rats stole softly across the old rag rug in
        front of the fireplace. With a leap, Puss
        landed close to the rats, and with his right
        paw, laid hold of the nearest, and with his
        left paw caught the other. "Squeak, squeak!
        Oh, let us go!" they cried.</p>

    <p>"Not unless you promise to leave this
        house," replied Puss, fiercely, his whiskers
        standing out straight and his eyes glaring
        like two balls of fire.</p>

    <p>"We will, we will!" squeaked the rats.</p>

    <p>"Then go!" cried Puss, "and don't you
        ever come back!"</p>

    <p>"We won't, we won't!" cried the terrified
        rats.</p>

    <p>And after that Puss softly crept into the
        kitchen, where on the table sat three little
        mice eating a piece of cake. In a second
        Puss had them fast in his claws.</p>

    <p>"Squeak, squeak!" screamed the little mice.</p>

    <p>"I'll spare you," said Puss, glaring at
        them with eyes as bright as automobile lamps.
        "I'll let you go if you'll promise to leave this
        house with all your sisters and brothers and
        cousins and aunts and fathers and mothers
        and grandmothers and grandfathers, and all
        your friends, and everybody else that I can't
        think of, for I'm so mad I could eat you."
    </p>

    <p>"Oh don't," they cried; "we'll go, we'll go!
        We'll promise to leave."</p>

    <p>And after that the little old man was never
        bothered with rats and mice.</p>

    <h2>MISTER FOX</h2>


    <div>IT was late in the evening as Puss, Junior,
        entered a gloomy forest. It was very
        dark beneath the big, tall trees, so by and by
        he stopped and looked about him, when all
        of a sudden&mdash;</div>

    <p>Well, as soon as the Fox had finished asking
        Lady Moon to show him the way Puss
        cried out:</p>

    <p>"Oh, Mr. Fox, take me with you, for I'm
        lost in this forest." But goodness me! the
        Fox was so frightened at the sound of Puss,
        Junior's, voice that he jumped behind a tree.</p>

    <p>"Who speaks to me?" he asked, faintly.</p>

    <p>"Puss in Boots, Junior."</p>

    <p>"Ah," replied the Fox, coming out from
        his hiding place, "now I'm not afraid. At
        first I thought you were a farmer; farmers
        don't like me!"</p>

    <p>"Why should they?" asked Puss. "You
        steal their ducks and chickens."</p>

    <p>"Softly, softly!" whispered the Fox;
        "someone may hear you."</p>

    <p>"Very well," replied Puss, "I'll whisper if
        you'll show me the way."</p>

    <p>"Come along," replied the Fox. So they
        walked along through the dark forest, and
        every now and then the moon peeped through
        the tree tops to help Mr. Fox find his way,
        but for all that, the forest was very gloomy
        and Puss nearly stumbled two or three times
        and so did Mr. Fox.</p>

    <p>"Do you hear what they say about me?"
        asked the Fox in a whisper.</p>

    <p>"They say you give them bad dreams," replied
        Puss; "that you keep them awake and
        ruin their nerves."</p>

    <p>"Ha, ha!" laughed Mr. Fox, "what do
        they expect? Do they imagine I come here
        to sing them to sleep? To stand under the
        coop window and sing a lullaby? Ha, ha!
        I'm very fond of duck and very fond of
        goose, but not in that way. Oh, my, no!"
        And he grinned until all his long white teeth
        shone in the moonlight.</p>

    <h2>MR. SLIPPER-SLOPPER</h2>


    <div>WHEN Mr. Fox laughed he showed all
        his long, sharp teeth, and Puss was
        mighty glad he had his trusty staff with him
        in case Mr. Fox became ugly. But nothing
        unpleasant happened, and by and by they
        came to the hen-house.</div>

    <p>Puss was peeking through a crack in the
        boards, but before he had time to utter a
        cry of warning, Mr. Fox,</p>

    <div>
        Seized the black duck by the neck,<br />
        And swung her across his back;<br />
        The black duck cried out, "Quack! quack! quack!"<br />
        With her legs hanging dangling down.<br />
    </div>

    <div>and away he went, out through the door,
        across the barnyard and up the hill. And I
        guess Lady Moon wished she hadn't shown
        that bad old fox the way through the dark
        forest.</div>

    <p>And after that Puss pounded on the
        kitchen door and shouted, "The fox has run
        off with the black duck!"</p>

    <p>"What's the matter?" asked Mrs. Slipper-Slopper.
        "Who has taken the black duck?"</p>

    <p>"Hurry up!" called Puss. "The fox has
        a good start; 'twill be hard to catch him."</p>

    <p>So Mrs. Slipper-Slopper pulled in her
        head and pretty soon came thumping down
        the stairs and opened the door.</p>

    <p>"Which way did the fox go?" asked Mr.
        Slipper-Slopper.</p>

    <p>"Up the hill," said Puss.</p>

    <p>"Where's my gun?" asked Mr. Slipper-Slopper,
        turning to his wife.</p>

    <p>"Why, don't you remember, John?" she
        replied. "You lent it to old Neighbor Jones
        last week."</p>

    <p>"So I did," said Mr. Slipper-Slopper.
        "Too bad!"</p>

    <p>"Well, I'm going after him, anyway,"
        cried Mr. Slipper-Slopper, picking up the
        broom. "If I catch him I'll hit him a
        whopper!"</p>

    <p>"You wouldn't hit an old man like Neighbor
        Jones?" cried Mrs. Slipper-Slopper excitedly.</p>

    <p>"No&mdash;&mdash;the fox," cried Mr. Slipper-Slopper.
        "I mean the fox."</p>

    <p>"You'd better put on your boots," said his
        wife. "You can't go in your slippers."</p>

    <h2>A DINNER INVITATION</h2>


    <div>GOODNESS me, Mr. Slipper-Slopper
        took so long to pull on his boots that
        Puss said, "Really, if you don't hurry the
        fox will be miles away, and you'll never get
        back your gray goose."</div>

    <p>"Yes, John, you had better take this
        young cat's advice," cried Mrs. Slipper-Slopper.</p>

    <p>"Gracious me!" exclaimed Puss to himself,
        "Mr. Slipper-Slopper is crazy. Why does
        he blow his horn? It's bad enough to hunt
        a fox with a broom!"</p>

    <p>"Look here, Mr. Slipper-Slopper," he
        cried, "you have no boots&mdash;you've nothing
        but slippers. You have no gun&mdash;you've nothing
        but an old broom. And what's more,
        you have no sense. You deserve to lose your
        gray goose and your black duck. Good-by."
        And Puss ran off in disgust.</p>

    <p>"I've no use for a man who can't protect
        his own," he muttered to himself. "I won't
        help catch that fox. Let him have a feast.
        He must eat as well as Mr. Slipper-Slopper.
        Probably Mr. Slipper-Slopper would have
        killed the gray goose for dinner in a few days,
        anyhow."</p>

    <p>"Helloa, what are you talking about?"
        cried Mr. Fox, jumping out from behind a
        large stone.</p>

    <p>"So you think old Slipper-Slopper would
        have killed the goose and eaten it himself,
        do you?" asked the fox with a grin.</p>

    <p>"Well," answered Puss, startled at the
        sudden appearance of Mr. Fox, "I thought
        it pretty mean of you to steal his goose, but
        now that I've found out what a foolish man
        Mr. Slipper-Slopper is, I'm glad you have a
        good dinner in store for yourself and family."</p>

    <p>"That's very nice of you," said Mr. Fox,
        with another grin.</p>

    <p>"Neither have I forgotten that you helped
        me out of the forest," continued Puss, "and
        I feel very friendly toward you."</p>

    <p>"If that's the case," said the fox in a kind
        voice, "you come home with me and Mrs.
        Fox will give you some of the best roast duck
        you ever tasted in your life."</p>

    <h2>ROAST DUCK</h2>


    <div>PUSS, JUNIOR, accepted the invitation
        of Mr. Fox to dine, for he was hungry,
        and the very thought of roast duck for supper
        made his mouth water.</div>

    <p>"Thank you, Mister Fox," he answered.
        "Let me carry the duck for you&mdash;the goose
        is enough of a load!"</p>

    <p>"You are right," replied the fox, handing
        the duck to Puss. "It was a hard run up
        that hill. If I had known the farmer better,
        however, I wouldn't have hurried so."</p>

    <p>"Well, lead the way, and I'll follow," said
        Puss.</p>

    <p>"This is Puss in Boots, Junior," he said,
        turning to his good wife, Mrs. Fox. "He has
        carried the duck for me, for I have a big
        fat goose."</p>

    <p>Then Mrs. Fox asked Puss to sit down and
        rest while she cooked the supper, and the
        little foxes begged him to tell them a story.</p>

    <p>"What kind of a story do you like?" asked
        Puss.</p>

    <p>"Tell them how I crept into the hen-house
        and got away from old Mr. Slipper-Slopper,"
        said Mr. Fox. "You keep them quiet and
        I'll pluck off the feathers while Mrs. Fox
        heats the oven. Then we'll lose no time in
        roasting the duck."</p>

    <p>"All right," replied Puss, "I'll tell them
        about it," and as soon as Mr. Fox went out
        of the room Puss commenced.</p>

    <p>"Your father and I crept softly into the
        barnyard and then your daddy tiptoed into
        the hen-house and said to Madam Goose:
        'By your leave, I'll take you away and carry
        you home to my den Oh!' I'm not quite sure
        whether he or Madam Goose said 'Oh!' but
        that doesn't make any difference."</p>

    <p>"I think it must have been Madam Goose,"
        said a little fox. "I think she was frightened."</p>

    <p>"Maybe you are right," said Puss, with
        a smile. "At any rate, when your father
        caught the black duck there was no mistake
        about what she said, it was 'Quack! quack!
        quack!'"</p>

    <p>Well, just then Mr. Fox came in and said
        dinner was ready.</p>



    <p>And Puss, Junior, had all he could eat, too.</p>

    <h2>TAFFY</h2>


    <p>"Well, I guess you did what was right,"
        said Puss, Junior, as he and Tom Thumb
        neared a butcher shop in a small village.</p>

    <p>The butcher, who had just spoken in
        rhyme, shifted from one foot to the other in
        an uneasy sort of way. "But that isn't all,"
        he went on to say, in rather an anxious tone
        of voice.</p>

    <p>"Tell us the worst, then," laughed Puss,
        Junior, who didn't appear very sympathetic,
        although the name Taffy appealed to him
        and made him wonder what sort of a person
        Taffy was.</p>

    <p>"The truth of the matter is," the butcher
        went on to say, "I hit him a bit too hard with
        the marrow-bone. His head is in bad shape,
        and the doctor says it will be some weeks yet
        before Taffy gets out of bed."</p>

    <p>"Gracious me!" exclaimed Tom Thumb.
        "Why weren't you more careful?"</p>

    <p>"That's just it," replied the butcher.
        "Why wasn't I more careful?" And then he
        gave a sigh and went into his shop to wait
        on a customer.</p>

    <p>"Let's make a call on Taffy," said Puss,
        Junior. "Somehow, I can't help liking him.
        I don't know whether it's on account of his
        name, or not. But Taffy sounds awfully
        nice to me."</p>

    <p>"It tastes awfully good to me," laughed
        Tom Thumb. "You must have him mixed
        up with candy. That's the reason you like
        him, I guess."</p>

    <p>"Come on and we'll soon find out," cried
        Puss, Junior. "I'm curious to see what
        'Welsh Taffy' is like." So they both walked
        up the street, inquiring on the way where
        Taffy lived. If the house Taffy owned was
        any indication that Taffy was a nice sort of
        person, it certainly spoke well for him, for
        it was the prettiest and most homelike little
        place Puss had ever seen.</p>

    <p>"I like him already," said Puss, as he
        knocked on the door.</p>

    <h2>A KIND VISIT</h2>


    <div>OF course, Taffy didn't come to the door.
        But a little Welshwoman did, and
        dropping a courtesy, she invited Puss and
        Tom Thumb to come in.</div>

    <p>"How is Taffy?" Puss asked.</p>

    <p>"His head is still painful," replied the
        little Welshwoman, "but for that he feels
        quite well, thank you," and she dropped another
        courtesy.</p>

    <p>"May we see him?" asked Tom Thumb.</p>

    <p>"Well, that I don't know," she replied,
        "but I will enquire. Won't you step into
        the sitting room?" So our two small visitors
        walked in and sat down. The little canary
        bird hopped about in her cage and the flowers
        in the green boxes in the bay-window nodded
        in the sunlight, as the big old clock in the
        far corner ticked away the minutes.</p>

    <p>"Come up and see Taffy," suddenly cried
        the voice of the little Welshwoman.</p>

    <p>I guess Puss had almost fallen asleep
        listening to the drowsy tick of the old clock
        and the low twitter of the canary. Everything
        was so quiet and home-like it reminded
        him of his old home when he had prowled
        about in the garret and discovered the story
        book, "Puss in Boots." Yes, Puss, Junior,
        felt a little bit homesick, for "no matter how
        humble, there's no place like home."</p>

    <p>Taking Tom Thumb by the hand, he followed
        the Welshwoman up the stairs, where
        they found Taffy sitting propped up in bed,
        his head done up in great bandages. But,
        oh, what pleasant blue eyes he had! And his
        red beard, big and soft, flowed down over
        the counterpane, and his big strong hand lay
        so quietly on his lap that Puss forgot he was
        Puss in Boots, Junior, son of the Seneschal
        to my Lord of Carabas, and jumped right
        up on the bed and nestled up to Taffy, purring
        away just like an ordinary cat!</p>

    <p>And what did Taffy do? Did he say
        "Scat! You'll get the counterpane all dirty
        with your red-topped boots!" No, he didn't.
        He just stroked Puss, Junior, with his big,
        kind hand, and the little Welshwoman picked
        up Tom Thumb and cuddled him in her
        bosom, saying in a low voice, "Dearie me, but
        it's nice to have friends come to see you when
        everybody in town is calling my Taffy a
        thief."</p>

    <p>And then a tear fell from her eye on little
        Tom Thumb's hat; but he didn't care, for
        somehow he felt there must be some mistake,
        and that Taffy wasn't to blame. And Puss
        felt the same way, for he kept on purring
        and rubbing his nose against Taffy's big
        red hand.</p>


    <h2>THE RED BEARD</h2>


    <div>BY and by Taffy stopped stroking Puss,
        Junior, and said in a kindly voice:</div>

    <p>"Well, my fine little cat, what can I do
        for you?"</p>

    <p>Puss, Junior, didn't know just what to
        answer. In fact, as he hadn't come for anything,
        he couldn't think of anything to fit the
        question. But little Tom Thumb, however,
        called over from where he was sitting in the
        Welshwoman's lap, that they had come to
        call, and that they were strangers in town,
        traveling through on a journey of adventure.</p>

    <p>"Did you hear what they say about me?"
        asked Taffy.</p>

    <p>"Yes, we did," replied Puss, "but, somehow,
        I didn't believe it then; and I'm very
        sure I don't believe it now."</p>

    <p>"Bless you for that," cried the little
        Welshwoman, "my Taffy is no thief. There
        has been a great mistake about it all."</p>

    <p>"Yes, that there has," said Taffy, "but
        how can I prove it? Someone with a red
        beard stole the piece of beef from the butcherman,
        and then they said it was I. But I was
        never near his place, nor did I lay hands on
        meat or marrow-bone."</p>

    <p>At that moment there came a loud knocking
        at the front door, and when the little
        Welshwoman opened it, whom should she
        find but the butcherman himself!</p>

    <p>"See what I have brought to you," he said,
        holding up a false red beard. "I found this
        to-day behind a barrel in my shop. It's like
        your Taffy's beard." At this the little
        Welshwoman opened her eyes very wide and
        tried to speak, but she was so surprised she
        couldn't.</p>

    <p>When the butcher went to say that perhaps
        the man who wore this beard was the
        one who had stolen his beef, the little Welshwoman
        began to cry softly, and the big
        butcher, who had a kind heart, said, "Don't
        cry, my good woman, I don't think now
        your Taffy stole the beef, and that's the
        reason I've come all the way up here to show
        you this beard. So you tell Taffy that I shall
        tell everybody in town that it wasn't he who
        stole my beef, but some thief who wore a red
        beard: and then, I'll show them what I found
        in my shop, and that will prove what I say.
        Everybody will be glad to know that Taffy
        isn't to blame."</p>

    <p>As soon as the butcher had gone, she flew
        upstairs to tell Taffy the good news. And
        it almost made Taffy cry. If he hadn't been
        a man, he would have. But it was hard work
        not to, just the same. "My head feels better
        already," he said with a laugh that had a
        big catch in it.</p>

    <p>"Take off the bandages, little woman. I'll
        come down to supper, and these two small
        friends of ours shall spend the night with
        us, for they have brought us good luck to-day,
        that they have."</p>

    <h2>ROBINSON CRUSOE</h2>


    <div>AFTER leaving Taffy, the Welshman,
        Puss, Junior, and little Tom Thumb
        walked along for many a mile until they came
        to the seashore. Right there in a sheltered
        cove lay a beautiful sailboat, on the stern of
        which was painted in gold letters:</div>

    <p>"Shall we accept the pretty boat's offer?"
        asked Puss, Junior.</p>

    <p>For answer Tom Thumb jumped in and,
        so without another word, Puss hoisted the
        sail and steered for the big blue ocean. All
        day and all night they sailed away, and when
        they woke in the morning they were surprised
        to find the little boat fast aground on
        a sandy beach.</p>

    <p>"How did we get here?" asked Puss,
        sleepily, for it was still early in the morning,
        and the sun had just begun to climb up to the
        sky, and the dew dripped from the tall
        meadow grass that grew close to the water's
        edge.</p>

    <p>"Through no fault of ours," replied little
        Tom Thumb, with a laugh.</p>

    <p>"Captain Puss, Junior, fell asleep at the
        helm, and the first mate, Tom Thumb, did
        likewise," he added, running up to the bow
        and looking over the land. "Why, it's an
        island," he called out. "I can see water on
        the other side."</p>

    <p>"You don't say so," said Puss. "Well,
        let's land." So they jumped ashore and
        walked up the beach towards a clump of
        trees.</p>

    <p>"Pretty nice sort of a place," said Tom
        Thumb. "Let's play Robinson Crusoe! I'll
        be your black man Friday. We can build a
        house under these trees, and as we have lots
        to eat on board ship, we can spend some time
        here without danger of starving."</p>

    <p>And just then, all of a sudden, a voice
        began to sing:</p>

    <p>"Who's that?" whispered Puss, Junior.</span>
        But he needn't have asked the question, for
        just then a man dressed all in skins came
        toward them.</p>

    <p>"Friends or enemies?" he asked.</p>

    <p>"Friends!" cried Puss, Junior.</p>

    <p>"Friends!" screamed Tom Thumb.</p>

    <p>"Welcome, then, to my island. I am
        Robinson Crusoe!"</p>

    <p>Puss and Tom were too amazed to answer
        for a few minutes. Then Puss, Junior,
        stretched out his right paw, saying: "I'm
        very pleased to meet you, Mr. Crusoe."</p>

    <p>"And so am I," said little Tom Thumb,
        standing on tiptoe and reaching up his hand.</p>

    <p>"Well, you're certainly as welcome as the
        flowers in May," said Robinson Crusoe.
        "Visitors are few and far between. Come
        with me to my house."</p>

    <h2>CRUSOE CASTLE</h2>


    <div>ROBINSON CRUSOE'S home was
        unlike anything Puss, Junior, had ever
        seen. Notwithstanding that he had visited
        many strange places and met many strange
        people, he was greatly surprised at Robinson
        Crusoe's style of dwelling. It wasn't exactly
        like a fort, and yet it was one. Tom Thumb
        said it reminded him of some of the strange
        castles he had seen while with Good King
        Arthur.</div>

    <p>It stood against the side of a small hill,
        surrounded by a high stockade. There was
        no door to it, but while Puss was wondering
        how they were going to get in, Robinson
        Crusoe placed a ladder against the wall and
        climbed up, saying, "Follow me, my friends;
        this is the way we enter Crusoe Castle."</p>

    <p>After reaching the top they descended by
        the same ladder, which, of course, was pulled
        up and lowered on the inside. A very nice
        looking tent met their eyes, back of which
        was a large cave hollowed out of the rocky
        hill.</p>

    <p>"Here is where I live, my little friends,"
        cried Robinson Crusoe. "This is my dog,
        Snoozer, and my two cats, Caromel and
        Caroline."</p>

    <p>Puss had never been very fond of dogs,
        but Snoozer came forward in such a respectful
        way that Puss took a liking to him at
        once. I suppose there were so few visitors
        at Crusoe Castle that Snoozer would have
        welcomed even a strange cat.</p>

    <p>With Caromel and Caroline, however,
        matters were different. Caromel from
        first was jealous of Puss. You see, he had
        no fine, red-topped boots, nor a sword and
        feathered cap. Caroline, however, made up
        for him. She thought Puss, Junior, just
        about the handsomest cat she had ever seen.
        Poor Caroline! She had never been off of
        Crusoe Island.</p>

    <p>For all that, however, I don't think if she
        had been all over the wide, wide world she
        would have met such a handsome cat as Puss,
        Junior. No, indeed! Puss, Junior, was the
        Prince of Cats; that goes without saying,
        though we have said it.</p>

    <p>"And now that we have all been introduced,
        let us sit down and talk," cried Robinson
        Crusoe, "for I've hardly spoken to a soul
        for many years. I've forgotten how a voice
        sounds."</p>

    <p>So they all began to talk and laugh and
        to tell all sorts of jokes and riddles until it
        began to grow dark. Then Robinson Crusoe
        jumped up and said, "Come and watch me
        get supper, for I am Lord and Chief Cook
        of Crusoe Castle."</p>

    <h2>FRIDAY</h2>


    <div>PUSS, JUNIOR, and Tom Thumb enjoyed
        their supper at Crusoe Castle
        better than any meal they ever had. "Even
        when I visited the Man in the Moon, the
        cheese wasn't as good as this," said Puss.</div>

    <p>"Glad you like it," said Mr. Crusoe, "I
        made it myself from goat's milk. I have
        some fine goats, let me tell you. I made me
        this coat from an old Nanny goat. Do you
        wonder how Crusoe could do so?"</p>

    <p>"Well, I suppose there are no tailors on
        Crusoe Island," said Tom Thumb.</p>

    <p>"I've never met any," replied Mr. Crusoe
        with a laugh. "I've never met anybody so
        far except goats and kids, parrots and
        monkeys, ducks and drakes, snakes and
        lizards."</p>

    <p>"Where did you get Snoozer and Caromel
        and Caroline?" asked Puss.</p>

    <p>"They came off the ship with me when it
        was wrecked," said Mr. Crusoe. "That is,
        I brought them off the next day when I went
        out on the raft to the wreck. And they've
        been with me ever since."</p>

    <p>"Oh, by the way," Puss, Junior, suddenly
        exclaimed. "Is Friday here?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, yes," cried Tom Thumb, "where is
        Friday?"</p>

    <p>Mr. Crusoe got up and walked over to a
        tall pole and looked over carefully the
        notches cut into the wood. "Let me see," he
        said. "To-day is Thursday. Yes, that's
        right; Friday will be here to-morrow."</p>

    <p>"You've made a mistake, Mr. Crusoe,"
        said Puss, with a laugh.</p>

    <p>"Have I," he replied, looking over his
        wooden calendar carefully a second time.</p>

    <p>"I don't mean the day," said Puss. "I
        mean your man Friday."</p>

    <p>"Oh, you mean my black man Friday,"
        said Mr. Crusoe. "Oh, I gave him a holiday.
        He'll be here to-morrow."</p>

    <p>"I'm very anxious to see him," said Tom
        Thumb.</p>

    <p>"He'll be surprised when he sees you, too,"
        said Mr. Crusoe, with a grin. "He's never
        seen a white man but me."</p>

    <p>By this time it was quite dark, so Mr.
        Crusoe lighted some very nice home-made
        candles and stuck them here and there in
        the cave. They gave a very soft light. The
        waves on the beach murmured gently, and
        pretty soon Snoozer was snoring and Caromel
        and Caroline were fast asleep on an old sack
        in a corner.</p>

    <p>"Let us turn in," said Mr. Crusoe, showing
        Puss and Tom a very comfortable hammock.
        In a short time everybody was sound
        asleep and snoring away in Crusoe Cave.</p>

    <h2>SUPPOSING</h2>


    <div>THE loud ringing of a bell awoke everyone
        in Crusoe Castle. Puss, Junior,
        jumped out of his hammock and little Tom
        Thumb yawned and asked in a sleepy voice,
        "Who's ringing the door-bell?" Then Mr.
        Crusoe picked up the ladder and went outside
        and, placing it against the fence, climbed
        up to the top, and after that he pulled up the
        ladder and then let it down on the outside.
        All this time Snoozer stood below wagging
        his tail, while Mr. Crusoe's two cats, Caromel
        and Caroline, purred and rubbed against the
        calendar pole. Pretty soon a curly-headed
        black face appeared above the wall.</div>

    <p>"Black man Friday," whispered Tom
        Thumb.</p>

    <p>"Bow-wow!" yelped Snoozer, and in a few
        minutes Mr. Crusoe and his man Friday
        climbed down the ladder.</p>

    <p>"This is my good man Friday," said Mr.
        Crusoe. So Puss and Tom Thumb shook
        hands with him, which seemed to please him
        immensely.</p>

    <p>"Glum-glum. Blum-blum!" he cried, smiling
        and showing a row of very white teeth.</p>

    <p>"That's 'Howdy! Pleased to meet you,'
        in his language," said Mr. Crusoe. "He can
        talk very little English yet. I've had little
        time to devote to his education so far."</p>

    <p>"But who rang the bell?" asked Puss,
        Junior.</p>

    <p>"Why, Friday did, of course," replied Mr.
        Crusoe. "Come over here and I'll show
        you," and he led Puss to the rear of the cave.</p>

    <p>"I brought this bell from the wreck," explained
        Mr. Crusoe. "After Friday came to me
        I tied a rope to it. At the other end of the
        rope I fastened a door-knob. When I go out
        Friday usually stays in. And when I ring
        the bell he lets down the ladder to me. And
        when he's out he rings the bell, just as he did
        this morning, and I let the ladder down to
        him."</p>

    <p>"What do you do when both of you go
        out?" asked Puss. "Does Snoozer attend to
        the ladder?"</p>

    <p>"No, no," replied Mr. Crusoe. "We hide
        the ladder in the woods nearby. Then when
        we come back we get it out and stand it up
        against the wall and climb up."</p>

    <p>"Supposing someone should come across
        the ladder and make a call while you're out?"
        asked Tom Thumb.</p>

    <p>"Well, I don't know whether they'd think
        of that if they just happened to find the
        ladder," answered Mr. Crusoe.</p>

    <p>"Well, supposing they did," said Tom
        Thumb.</p>

    <p>"Caesar's Ghost!" cried Mr. Crusoe. "Suppose
        we don't do any more supposing! I've
        been so long alone that I've forgotten how
        to play that game. Let's all go down to the
        beach and get some fresh soft clams for
        breakfast. Start the water boiling, Friday,
        we're going to have steamed clams for breakfast."
        And then Mr. Crusoe climbed up the
        ladder, with Puss and Tom Thumb close at
        his heels.</p>

    <h2>THREE MEN IN A TUB</h2>


    <div>ON reaching the seashore, Robinson
        Crusoe raised a spy glass to his eyes
        and looked carefully over the water. And
        then all of a sudden he lowered the glass and
        whispered: "The cannibals are coming! We
        must go back to my fort at once."</div>

    <p>"Do they eat cats?" asked Puss, Junior.</p>

    <p>"I don't know," replied Mr. Crusoe. "You
        see, I've never met a cannibal; in fact, I've
        always held aloof from them."</p>

    <p>Crusoe's man Friday was nearly frightened
        to death. He was as pale as a black ghost,
        which is pretty white for a negro.</p>

    <p>Once inside the fort, Mr. Crusoe again
        took a look at the cannibals. "Why, I guess
        I've made a mistake," he cried; "it's a tub,
        not a canoe!"</p>

    <p>"Well, that's good news," cried Puss,
        Junior, while Black Man Friday jumped
        about in great glee. You see, he had escaped
        only a short time before from the cannibals.</p>

    <p>Little Tom Thumb, although safe inside
        Puss, Junior's, pocket, was also relieved.
        The only one who didn't seem overjoyed was
        Mr. Crusoe himself.</p>

    <p>"What's the matter now?" said Puss.</p>

    <p>Mr. Crusoe gave a deep sigh. "If you
        owed the butcher, the baker and the candlestick
        maker as much as I do you wouldn't
        be overjoyed at seeing them, either."</p>

    <p>"But I'd rather see them than cannibals,"
        cried Tom Thumb. "I'd rather they'd take
        my money than my life!"</p>

    <p>"That's very true," said Mr. Crusoe, "but
        you don't quite get me. The laws on this
        island are very strict. They will allow you
        to shoot a cannibal at sight but not your grocery
        man."</p>

    <p>"Then you are powerless against these
        three men in a tub?" said Puss, Junior.</p>

    <p>"Well, not exactly," replied Mr. Crusoe.
        "I needn't answer the bell, you know."</p>

    <p>By this time the three men had landed on
        the beach, and pretty soon the doorbell rang.</p>

    <p>"S-s-sh!" whispered Mr. Crusoe, "don't
        make a sound. They can pull the handle off,
        for all I care."</p>

    <p>They didn't do this, but they kept the bell
        going until every one in Crusoe Castle was
        nearly crazy. First the butcher took a hand,
        then the baker, and then the candlestick
        maker. Then they began all over again.</p>

    <h2>A BIG FISH</h2>


<div>"IF those fellows don't stop ringing that
        bell, I'll get out my gun," said Robinson
        Crusoe. "I didn't get the bell for
        them; it's all paid for long ago."</div>

    <p>At that moment, the bell-cord snapped,
        and the baker, who had just given the handle
        a dreadful yank, fell over backwards and
        rolled down the hill to the beach.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Crusoe's not at home," said the
        butcher. "We might as well go back." So
        he and the candlestick maker went down to
        the shore and joined the baker; and then all
        three got into the tub and sailed away.</p>

    <p>"And we must do the same," said Puss,
        Junior. "Tom Thumb and I thank you very
        much for our nice visit on your island, but
        it's time we went forth again on our journey
        of adventure."</p>

    <p>"Well, I'm sorry to see you go," said Robinson
        Crusoe. And after that Puss shoved
        off the little boat and soon he and Tom were
        far out of sight on the big, wide sea.
    </p>

    <p>"Well, as the wind is in the South, why
        don't you fish?" cried Captain Puss, Junior.
        So Tom Thumb started in, and presently he
        felt a tremendous tug on the line.</p>

    <p>"I've got a fish! I've got a fish!" he cried,
        and then he began pulling in his line as fast
        as he could. But, oh dear me! It wasn't a
        fish after all, but a great big whale!</p>

    <p>"Don't you pull on that line any more,"
        cried the whale, "if you do I'll smash your
        boat."</p>

    <p>"Oh, is that so," said little Tom Thumb,
        although, of course, he was frightened almost
        to death, but what was the use to show fear?
        It would only make things worse, and if he
        put on a bold front, perhaps the whale would
        let them alone.</p>

    <p>"I'll take the hook out of your nose, if
        you'll promise not to swallow me," said little
        Tom Thumb.</p>

    <p>"All right," said the whale, and then Tom
        tried to pull it out. But it was in so tight
        that the whale began to spout great big tears.
        "Oh, dear me! It hurts just like a tooth!"</p>

    <p>"Well, it's your own fault!" said Tom.
        "Next time don't swallow everything that
        comes along!"</p>

    <h2>MARY LEE</h2>


    <div>"IF you're not more careful, I'll spout
        water over your boat and sink it," cried
        the whale, growing tired of Tom Thumb's
        fruitless endeavors to get the fish hook out.
        "My nose is bleeding now and the hook is
        still in it."</div>

    <p>"Let me give the string a yank," said Tom
        Thumb. "Didn't you ever have a tooth
        pulled out that way? It won't hurt much."</p>

    <p>"Well, go ahead," said the whale, closing
        his eyes and shutting his teeth tight. And
        then out came the hook and over went Tom
        into the bottom of the boat.</p>

    <p>"Ouch! Ouch!" said the whale, while little
        Tom Thumb picked himself up and said to
        Puss, Junior, "Don't you ever ask me to fish
        again in the ocean. I'd rather fish like
        Simple Simon."</p>

    <p>"What are you grumbling about?" asked
        the whale, peering over the side of the boat.
        "One would think you had been caught with
        a hook," and saying this disagreeable thing,
        he dived down into the sea.</p>

    <p>"No more fishing for me," laughed Tom
        Thumb.</p>

    <p>And just then they came close to a lighthouse
        on a big rock. So they ran the boat up
        on the little stretch of sand.</p>

    <p>"I don't know what we're landing for,"
        said Captain Puss, Junior, "only I've never
        been in a lighthouse and here's a good
        chance."</p>

    <p>"Haven't you?" asked a pretty voice, and
        a young girl appeared on the stone steps leading
        down to the beach. "Come, my gallant
        tars, and I'll show you my lighthouse and
        after that you can tell me some of your
        adventures, for 'tis a lonely life I lead here
        alone on the rock until my Bobby Shafto
        returns."</p>

    <p>So Puss picked up Tom Thumb and followed
        the girl into the lighthouse and up the
        stairs to the very top where the great lamp
        sent out its rays of light to guide the ships
        at night; or the great bell clanged in foggy
        weather to warn the weary sailor from the
        cruel rocks.</p>

    <h2>STORY-TELLING</h2>


    <div >AFTER they had seen everything there
        was to be seen they all went into the
        cosy kitchen, Puss, Junior, with Tom Thumb
        on his shoulder and the pretty girl who kept
        the lighthouse.</div>

    <p>"And now we shall have supper," she said.
        "And after that, when the lamp is lighted in
        the tower, we'll sit outside on the doorstep
        and Puss, Junior, shall tell me one of his
        adventures."</p>

    <p>"Well, what shall I tell and where shall I
        begin?" asked Puss, when they all were
        seated outside the lighthouse.</p>

    <p>"Tell me how you and Tom became fellow
        travelers," said the girl, taking Tom up in
        her hand and placing him on her knee.</p>

    <p>"Willingly," said Puss, stroking his
        whiskers and curling his great mustache,
        "and should I make a mistake in the telling
        Tom may correct me.</p>

    <p>"When I left my father at the Castle of
        my Lord of Carabas I had gone but a few
        miles when I came to Tom Thumb's house.
        And as soon as his mother saw me she asked
        me to go to King Arthur's Court and find
        out about her son, Tom Thumb. She had
        made him but a few days before a small cambric
        parasol, and with this as a sort of airship
        he had floated off on the wind to the castle.
        When I got there I found that poor Tom
        was imprisoned in a mousetrap. He had
        fallen into the dough which the royal baker
        was about to bake into cakes for King Arthur.
        And this had so angered the baker that he
        had thrown Tom into a mousetrap."</p>

    <p>"It was worse than that, I was to be
        beheaded," interposed Tom. "I owe my life
        to Puss, Junior."</p>

    <p>At this, Puss actually blushed, for he was
        a modest little cat, although he had traveled
        much and had been royally treated.</p>

    <p>"Say not so, my dear Tom," he cried, "for
        King Arthur was only too glad to comply
        with my request when I asked him to release
        you. In fact, it was not because he feared my
        sword, but because he liked my rhyme."</p>

    <p>"How did it run?" asked the girl. And
        Puss, blushing still more deeply, commenced
        to recite this little verse</p>



    <p>"Is that what you said?" cried little Tom
        Thumb. "Dear, dear Puss, I shall never forget
        what you did for me!"</p>

    <p>Dear, dear! Here we are at the end of
        the book and poor little Puss, Junior, has
        not yet found his father. Maybe he will in
        the next book.</p>

    <h2>THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS SERIES</h2>

        <b>Handsomely Bound. Colored Wrappers. Illustrated.</b><br />

        &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
    </div>

    <p>This series presents early American history in a manner
        that impresses the young readers. Because of George and
        Martha Washington Parke, two young descendants of the
        famous General Washington, these stories follow exactly
        the life of the great American, by means of playing they
        act the life of the Washingtons, both in battles and in
        society.</p>


    <div><br />THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS</div>

    <p>Their thrilling battles and expeditions generally end in "punishment"
        lessons read by Mrs. Parke from the "Life of Washington." The culprits
        listen intently, for this reading generally gives them new ideas for further
        games of Indian warfare and Colonists' battles.</p>


    <div><br />THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS' RELATIVES</div>

    <p>The Davis children visit the Parke home and join zealously in the games
        of playing General Washington. So zealously, in fact, that little Jim
        almost loses his scalp.</p>


    <div><br />THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS' TRAVELS</div>

    <p>The children wage a fierce battle upon the roof of a hotel in New York
        City. Then, visiting the Davis home in Philadelphia, the patriotic Washingtons
        vanquish the Hessians on a battlefield in the empty lot back of
        the Davis property.</p>


    <div><br />THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS AT SCHOOL</div>

    <p>After the school-house battle the Washingtons discover a band of gypsies
        camping near the back road to their homes and incidentally they secure
        the stolen horse which the gypsies had taken from the "butter and egg
        farmer" of the Parkes.</p>


    <div><br />THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS' HOLIDAYS</div>

    <p>They spend a pleasant summer on two adjoining farms in Vermont.
        During the voyage they try to capture a "frigate" but little Jim is caught
        and about to be punished by the Captain when his confederates hasten in
        and save him.</p>

    <p>A splendid new line of interesting tales for the little
        ones, introducing many of the well known characters of
        fairyland in a series of novel adventures. The Flyaways
        are a happy family and every little girl and boy will want
        to know all about them.</p>


    <div><br />THE FLYAWAYS AND CINDERELLA</div>

    <p>How the Flyaways went to visit Cinderella only to find that Cinderella's
        Prince had been carried off by the Three Robbers, Rumbo, Hibo and Jobo.
        "I'll rescue him!" cried Pa Flyaway and then set out for the stronghold of
        the robbers. A splendid continuation of the original story of Cinderella.</p>

    <p>On their way to visit Little Red Riding Hood the Flyaways fell in with
        Tommy Tucker and The Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe. They told
        Tommy about the Magic Button on Red Riding Hood's cloak. How the
        wicked Wolf stole the Magic Button and how the wolves plotted to eat up
        Little Red Riding Hood and all her family, and how the Flyaways and
        King Cole sent the wolves flying, makes a story no children will want to miss.</p>


    <div><br />THE FLYAWAYS AND GOLDILOCKS</div>

    <p>The Flyaways wanted to see not only Goldilocks but also the Three
        Bears and they took a remarkable journey through the air to do so. Tommy
        even rode on a Rocket and met the monstrous Blue Frog. When they
        arrived at Goldilock's house they found that the Three Bears had been there
        before them and mussed everything up, much to Goldilock's despair. "We
        must drive those bears out of the country!" said Pa Flyaway. Then they
        journeyed underground to the Yellow Palace, and oh! so many things happened
        after that!</p>

    practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

    THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
    PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
    
    To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
    distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
    (or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
    Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
    Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
    https://gutenberg.org/license).
    
    
    Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
    electronic works
    
    1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
    electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
    and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
    (trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
    the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
    all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
    If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
    Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
    terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
    entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
    
    1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
    used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
    agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
    things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
    even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
    paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
    Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
    and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
    works.  See paragraph 1.E below.
    
    1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
    or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
    Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
    collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
    individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
    located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
    copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
    works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
    are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
    Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
    freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
    this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
    the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
    keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
    Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
    
    1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
    what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
    a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
    the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
    before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
    creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
    Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
    the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
    States.
    
    1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
    
    1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
    access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
    whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
    phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
    Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
    copied or distributed:
    
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
    almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
    re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
    with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org
    
    1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
    from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
    posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
    and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
    or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
    with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
    work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
    through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
    Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
    1.E.9.
    
    1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
    with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
    must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
    terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
    to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
    permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.
    
    1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
    License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
    work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.
    
    1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
    electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
    prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
    active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
    Gutenberg-tm License.
    
    1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
    compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
    word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
    distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
    "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
    posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
    you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
    copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
    request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
    form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
    License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
    
    1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
    performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
    unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
    
    1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
    access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
    that
    
    - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
         the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
         you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
         owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
         has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
         Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
         must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
         prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
         returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
         sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
         address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
         the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."
    
    - You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
         you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
         does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
         License.  You must require such a user to return or
         destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
         and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
         Project Gutenberg-tm works.
    
    - You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
         money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
         electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
         of receipt of the work.
    
    - You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
         distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.
    
    1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
    electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
    forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
    both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
    Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
    Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.
    
    1.F.
    
    1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
    effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
    public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
    collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
    works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
    "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
    corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
    property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
    computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
    your equipment.
    
    1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
    of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
    Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
    Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
    Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
    liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
    fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
    LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
    PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
    TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
    LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
    INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
    DAMAGE.
    
    1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
    defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
    receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
    written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
    received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
    your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
    the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
    refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
    providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
    receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
    is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
    opportunities to fix the problem.
    
    1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
    in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
    WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
    
    1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
    warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
    If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
    law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
    interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
    the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
    provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
    
    1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
    trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
    providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
    with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
    promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
    harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
    that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
    or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
    work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
    Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.
    
    
    Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
    
    Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
    electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
    including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
    because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
    people in all walks of life.
    
    Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
    assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
    goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
    remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
    Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
    and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
    To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
    and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
    and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.

    Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
    Literary Archive Foundation
    
    Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
    spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
    increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
    freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
    array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
    ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
    status with the IRS.
    
    The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
    charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
    States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
    considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
    with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
    where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
    SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
    particular state visit https://pglaf.org
    
    While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
    have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
    against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
    approach us with offers to donate.
    
    International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
    any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
    outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
    
    Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
    methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
    ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
    donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate
    
    
    Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
    works.
    
    Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
    concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
    with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
    Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
    
    
    Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
    editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
    unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
    keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
    
    
    Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
    
         https://www.gutenberg.org
    
    This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
    including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
    Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
    subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
